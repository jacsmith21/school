## Questions
**Find the Closest Node in a Binary Search Tree**
– Given a binary search tree and a value k, please find a node in
the binary search tree whose value is the closest to k.
– For instance, in the binary search tree in Figure, the node that is
the closest to 29 is the node with value 28.

**Nodes with Sum in a Binary Search Tree (BST)**
– Given a binary search tree (no two nodes have the same values),
please check whether there exist two nodes in the BST whose
sum equals a given value.
– For example, if the given sum is 66, there are two nodes in
Figure with value 25 and 41 whose sum is 66. While the given
sum is 58, there do not exist two nodes whose sum is the same
as the given value.

**Trace the execution of the partition algorithm**
-to show how it partitions the array: 'N', 'A', 'N', 'Y',
'A', 'N', 'G', 'U', 'N', 'I' in the alphabetical order

**Show the steps of quicksort**
- on the array: 12, 30, 21, 8, 6, 9, 1, 7

**Consider performing counting sort on the following array: [5 7 5 1 3 7 6 3 1 6 6 5 3]**
- What does the final count array look like?
- Use the count array to determine the sorted array.

**Trace the steps of radix sort on the following sequence of numbers, each with 4 digits.**
- 5890, 6204, 8267, 6850, 4668

**Complexities**
- Heapify -> O(n)

**Words**
- Complete Binary Tree: Every level is completely filled except for the last level (Lu's definition seems to be "every level is completely full")
- Full Binary Tree: Every node has 0 or 2 children
- Binary Tree: Keys are not sorted
- Binary Search Tree: Keys are sorted
