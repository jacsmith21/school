# Lecture 14: Gene Regulation Prokaryotes
Different cells and tissues have different functions. Therefore, they need to express different genes. Furthermore, these requirements are constantly changing. Gene regulation is what maintains the genes that are expressed.

## Location of Regulation
Gene regulation occurs at several levels of gene expression.

### Genes
* Chromatin Packing
* Transcription initiation

### RNA
* RNA Stability
* RNA Processing
* Translation Initiation
* Translation Termination

### Polypeptide
* Protein modification
* Protein Stability / Activation

## Biochemical Pathways
Synthesis or degradation of cellular substances usually requires several steps. A substance may use several enzymes before it becomes the final product. A *biological pathway* is a series of actions among molecules in a cell that leads to a certain product or change within the cell. These enzymes must be present at the same time, meaning all the genes that encode these proteins must be turned on.

## Operons
The term *operon* is used to describe the promoter, operator and gene(s); however, they do not include the *regulatory gene*. Genes that encode proteins in a common pathway often cluster together so that they can be expressed by one promoter. For example, a transport protein and a degradation enzyme may be located one after the other on a chromosome. Each will have it's own AUG and STOP codons. These are known as *transcriptional* units.

*Operons* enable coordinated gene expressions through the use of clustering and *regulatory proteins*. They bind to certain sequences in the promoter. Together, they control access of RNA polymerase to the promoter. These proteins can be controlled by small molecules. *Allosteric proteins* have two different shapes which can be altered by the addition of a small molecule. This characteristic can be used to alter it's function and prevent certain substrates from binding.

### Repressor
*Repressors* block RNA polymerase II from binding with the promoter. The repressor is synthesized by the upstream *regulatory gene*.

For example, consider the tryptophan operon. When tryptophan is available, *tryptophan*, a *corepressor*, binds with a repressor protein to activate it. The trp operon is usually ON.

Furthermore, consider the *lac operon*. When lactose is present, the *β-galactosidase* enzyme and the *permease* transport protein need to be produced. The lac operon is usually OFF. Therefor, the repressor *Lacl* is initially active. It binds to the operon *lacO* at two points and overlaps the lacZYA promoter to prevent transcription. The repressor is inactivated by *allolactose*, an *inducer*.

### Activator
*Activators* facilitate the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoters (they increase *affinity*).

Again, consider the *lac operon*. When glucose is present, the operon should still be OFF. This is done through the use of activator proteins which *positively regular operons*. The lac operon is positively regulated by the *CAP protein* (*catabolite activate protein*). This protein only binds with the lac operon when *cAMP* is present (*cAMP* activates the *CAP protein*) and *cAMP* is only present when glucose is scarce. The *cAMP-CAP* combination binds to DNA near the lac promoter and interacts with RNA polymerase.

## Corepressors & Inducers
These are often substrates or products of the pathways they control.

# Lecture 15: Eukaryotic Gene Regulation
Eukaryotic cells must coordinate gene expression such that the only the right genes are expressed when needed. This is different from prokaryotic cells which do not typically live in colonies and all have the same task.

## Cell Differentiation
There is a lot of differentiation within human cells. Each one typically expresses only 20% of their protein-coding genes and cells such as neurons or muscle cells express even less. This is due to *differential gene expression* (this applies to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells).

## Regulation of Chromatin Structure
The location of a gene's promoter relative to the placement of nucleosomes and to the sites where the DNA attaches to the *chromosome scaffold* can affect whether a gene is transcribed or not. Furthermore, genes within highly condensed areas are not typically expressed.

## Histone Modification
The modification of histones directly affects the regulation of genes. *Histone acetylation*, the addition of acetyl, promotes gene expression by opening up the chromatin structure. However, the addition of methyl groups reduces transcription. *DNA methylation* primarily occurs in plants, animals and fungi. Genes typically maintain methylation throughout cell divisions. This accounts for *genomic imprinting* in mammals, where methylation permanently regulates expression of genes at the start of development.

*Epigenetic inheritance* is the inheritance of traits transmitted by mechanisms not involving the nucleotide sequence. This includes modifications to the chromatin structure. *Epigenetic information* may be the answer to differences between genetically identical cells.

## Regulation of Transcription Initiation
After chromatin modification, regulation of transcription initiation is the next step in gene expression regulation.

*Control elements* are segments of non-coding DNA that serve as binding sites for proteins called *transcription factors*, which in turn regulates gene expression. *Proximal* control elements are those located just upstream of the promoter whereas *distal control elements* are located farther up (may be thousands of nucleotides away). Groupings of distant groupings are also known as *enhancers*. Each gene will have multiple enhancers; however, each enhancer is typically associated with only one gene. In eukaryotic cells, the rate of gene expression can be increased or decreased by the binding of specific transcription factors to these *distal control elements*. *Transcription activators* are proteins which have two key components. They have a DNA binding domain, where they can bind the to DNA, and one or more activation domains, where they bind to other regulatory proteins or components of the transcription machinery. Protein-mediated bending is the current mechanisms believed to bring these enhances closer to *mediator proteins*, *transcription coactivator*, which help assemble the *initiation complex*.

Some *transcription factors* also act as *repressors* by several different mechanisms. For example, some block activator binding within enhancers. Others interfere with the activators directly. Furthermore, some activators and repressors act on the chromatin structure directly by promoting protein *acetylation* or *de-acetylation* (also referred to as *silencing*).

## Combinatorial Control of Gene Activation
Although the number of unique control elements (unique DNA sequences) is small, the number of possible enhancers is large due to the factorial growth of combinations. Each combination will be able to activate transcription only when the appropriate activator proteins are present.

This feature is also the means by which prokaryotic cells express multiple genes at the same time. Activator proteins recognize specific control elements independent of gene location. Therefore, genes may be spread out across multiple chromosomes. Coordinated control of dispersed gene expression usually occurs due to chemical signals. For example, a steroid hormone enters the cell and binds to a specific intracellular receptor protein, forming a hormone-receptor complex. Every gene whose transcription is stimulated by this given steroid has a control element recognized by the complex. This mechanism also applies to transmembrane receptors which activate *signal transduction pathways*.

Inside the nucleus, recent evidence points to congregation of active genes in the interior regions while non-expressed genes are typically found on the exterior.

# Lecture 16: Enzyme and Pathways
This lecture includes the making and breaking of biological molecules. *Metabolism* is all of an organisms biochemical reactions. The metabolic pathways of life form large complex networks.

## Metabolic Pathways
A *metabolic pathways* begins with a specific molecule and end with the formation of a specific product. Each of these reaction is catalyzed by a specific enzyme.

The two main types of pathways include *catabolic pathways* (breaking down of complex molecules) and *anabolic pathways* (building up of complex molecules). Catabolic reactions release energy whereas anabolic reactions consume it. Energy change is measured by *Gibb's Free Energy* where ΔG = ΔG products - ΔG reactants. Therefore, exergonic reactions release energy, the reaction is spontaneous ΔG is negative. Endergonic reactions consume energy, are not spontaneous and ΔG is positive. These facts indicate which require an input of energy and which reactions supply energy for cellular work; however, they do not indicate at which rates the reactions will occur.

The rate of reactions increase by enzymes. They act as catalyst and speed up the reaction. Reactants (substrates) contort into unstable configuration during their *transition state*. They require an *energy of activate*. Enzymes lower this energy barrier.

## Enzymes
Each enzyme has a unique shape which determines which chemical reaction it will catalyze. *Substrates* bind to an enzyme's *active site* (pocket on surface). The shapes of both the enzyme and substrates change upon binding, breaking and forming new bonds. Enzymes reduce activation energy by inducing the transition state by:

1. Brining the reacting molecules together in the correct orientation. This reduces the reliance on random collisions.
1. Changing the shape of the substrate molecule to achieve the transition state
1. Exposing the reactants to an altered chemical (charged) environment to promote *catalysis*. The R-groups of the amino acids on the enzyme interact with the substrate.

The ability of enzymes to catalyze reactions is influenced by the cellular environment, physical factors, temperature, salt concentration, pH, etc. Each enzyme will have unique optimal factors.

Enzymes may also be inhibited *competitive inhibitors* or *noncompetitive inhibitors*. These are important for regulation of enzyme activity. Many drugs, antibiotics, toxins and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. *Cofactors* are inorganic and organic chemicals that assist enzymes during the *catalysis* of reactions.

# Lecture 17: Glycolysis
Cellular respiration is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose and produces ATP. It occurs at several stages including *glycolysis*, *pyruvate oxidation*, the *Krebs cycle* and *oxidative phosphorylation*.

*Glycolysis* is a series of chemical reactions that breaks down glucose into two molecules three-carbon molecules of *pyruvate*. It takes place in the cytosol of the cell and can be broken down into two main phases.

## Energy-Requiring Phase
During this phase, the glucose molecule is rearranged and two phosphate groups are attached. This turns it into *fructose-1,6-bisphosphate*, an unstable molecule which allows it to split in two to form *glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate*. As two phosphate groups are attached, two *ATP* molecules are used up.

## Energy-Releasing Phase
In this phase, each three-carbon molecule is transformed into *pyruvate*. There are 4 *ATP* molecules and 2 *NADH* molecules created during the two reactions.

## ATP
*Adenine Tri-Phosphate* is the energy currency of the cell. It contains an *adenine* molecule, a *ribose* sugar and three phosphate groups. In between the phosphate groups there are *phosphoanhydride bonds*.

During ATP hydrolysis, an H2O molecule is used to break the ending phosphate group off the chain, forming ADP. This reaction is offers large amounts of energy as there is repulsion between the negatively charged products and the resonance stabilization of the products.

## NADH
*Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide* function as an electron shuttle. NAH+ is reduced to form NADH in a reaction using *dehydrogenase* and two hydrogen two hydrogen molecules.

## Yeast
Yeast uses both aerobic and anaerobic reactions to produce energy. As the *dissolved oxygen tension* decreases, yeast switches from aerobic to anaerobic reactions.

# Lecture 18: Respiration
Respiration uses the products of glycolysis to produce more ATP. It occurs within the *mitochondria*.

## Pyruvate Oxidation
*Pyruvate oxidation* links glycolysis to the *citric acid cycle*. For eukaryotes, this reaction typically occurs in the *matrix*, the innermost compartment of the mitochondria. In prokaryotes, this occurs in the cytoplasm. Overall, this process converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA, also producing one NADH molecule and releasing one carbon dioxide molecule. Furthermore, this step involves the oxidation of pyruvate.

## Citric Acid Cycle
During the *citric acid cycle*, acetyl CoA combines with a four-carbon molecule before entry a cycle of reactions where ultimately the four-carbon molecule is regenerated. During the reactions, two molecules of CO2 are released, three NADH, one molecule of FADH2, another electron transporter, and one molecule of both ATP and GTP.

*Citrate* is the first molecule formed during the citric acid cycle. Acetyl CoA combines with *oxaloacetate*, the four carbon molecule, to form the compound.

## Oxidative Phosphorylation
The electron transport carriers produced during the other steps deposit their electrons in the electron transport chain and are transformed into their oxidative states. The electrons move down the membrane of the matrix while releasing energy. This energy is then used to pump protons across the membrane, forming an *electro-chemical gradient*. As protons flow back to the inner matrix, the pass through *ATP synthase* (*ATPase*), producing ATP. At the end of the chain, electrons are accepted by oxygen (which also uses protons) to form water.

*Cytochrome c* is a small protein which carries one electron between *complex III* and *complex IV* (also known as *cytochrome c oxidase*). *Complex IV* receives four cytochrome c molecules and helps in the synthesis of 2H20.

During *chemiosmosis*, ATP is synthesized by the flow of H+ back into the matrix. It uses the *proton motive force*. A rotor within the membrane spins when a proton flows past which also spins a rod. This rod extends down into the *knob*. Three catalytic sites join a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP.  

## Reduction & Activation Energy
The more negative activation energy, the less likely it will be reduced. The more positive activation energy, the more likely it will be reduced.

# Lecture 19: Respiration
This lecture contained question about respiration.

## Fermentation
The production of ethanol (or lactic acid) regenerates NADH+ to allow for glycolysis to continue. This occurs in the absence of oxygen.

After beer is fermented, it is chilled, causing the proteins to precipitate and the removal of various compounds that import off-flavours. Small brewers carbonate the beer by adding small amounts of sugar to allow for yeast to produce CO2. Breweries directly infuse the CO2.

# Lecture 20: Exercise Metabolism
When an individual looses weight, they use up fat storage in their body. The weight itself is primarily lost from CO2 and sweat/urine.

## Metabolism of Glucose
* Glycolysis produces 2 ATP & NADH
* Fermentation remove 2 NADH
* TCA produces 2 ATP & FADH2 and 8 NADH
* Oxidative Phosphorylation produces 26-28 ATP

## Energy Systems for Exercise
All cells have muscle cells have ATP, but only enough to last around 3 seconds of intense exercise.

* *Creatine phosphate* is a high energy density molecule that can be broken down by cells to form ATP. This will provide you with 8-10 seconds of working your muscles at a high rate. *Creatine phosphate* + ADP -> *creatine* + ATP
* *Glycolysis-fermentation* is the glycolysis fermentation cycle. This cycle does not take any oxygen and therefore can provide energy for up to 90 seconds.
* *Glycolysis-TCA-Oxidative Phosphorylation* is the usual energy cycle. Within two minutes of exercise, the body starts supplying muscles with more oxygen.

The body stores energy in multiple forms. These types of molecules enter the aerobic cycle at different locations. This list includes:
* Glucose in cells & food
* Glycogen from liver
* Fat reserves
* Protein

# Lecture 21: Photosynthesis
*Photosynthesis* is the process by which plants, algae and some bacteria use sunlight to drive the synthesis of organic molecules, usually from carbon dioxide and water.

## Keeling Curve
A *Keeling Curve* is a graph that plots the ongoing change in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

## Terminology
All green plant tissues can photosynthesize; however, the majority occurs in the leaves. These have a middle layer of leaf tissue called *mesophyll* which are the primary site of photosynthesis. Small pores called *stomata* on the surface of plant cells allow for CO2 to diffuse into the mesophyll layer and oxygen diffuse out. Each mesophyll cell contains organelles called chloroplasts. Within each there are disc like structures called *thylakoids* which are stacked together to form *grana*. The fluid space around the *grana* is known as the *stroma*. The membrane of each *thylakoid* contains green-colored pigments referred to as *chlorophylls* and within the membrane is known as the *thylakoid space*.

*Chlorophyll* contains a double bond system of *porphyrin ring* which is responsible for absorbing the light. *Chlorophyll a* contains CH3 whereas *chlorophyll b* contains CHO. The central bound Mg2+ affects the electron distribution within the ring. The hydrophobic tail keeps it within the membrane.

## Light-Dependent Reactions
These reactions take place in the thylakoid membrane and require a supply of light energy. Chlorophylls absorb this light and convert it ATP and *NADPH*. *NADPH* is similar to NADH; however, it also has an extra phosphate group attached to one of the sugars. NADPH is the terminal acceptor and the ATP is synthesized with ATP synthase, similar to mitochondria. During this reaction, H2O is oxidized and O2 is produced.

## Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions)
The *Calvin Cycle* takes place within the stroma. During these reactions, the products from the *light-independent reactions*, in addition to CO2, react to form (Ch2O)n (typically *glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate*, or *G3P*) sugars which then combine to form glucose. During this reaction, CO2 is reduced.

This cycle takes 3CO2, 9 ATP & 6 NADPH as input and produces 1 *G3P*, 6 NADP+ and 9 *ADP* & *P groups*. It is a four step process that involves carbon fixation to 3 *RuBP*, reduction of 6 *3-PGA* to 6 *G3P* and the regeneration of 3 RuBP with the ATP & NADPH*.

*G3P* is used to produce both glucose, sucrose and starches for the cell. The sucrose exits the cell the be used by the plant. During the night, starches may be used as an energy source.

## Carotenoids
*Carotenoids* are organic pigments that are produced by plants and algae. *β-carotene* is a yellow/orange pigment that gives vegetables and fruit their rick colors.

## Light Absorbing Pigment Molecules
When light is absorbed, electrons transfer to higher orbitals. To release that energy, there are several options:

* Release photon
* Donate electron to electron acceptor
* Send light to another pigment molecule

## Photosystem
Within the membranes of thylakoids, there exist *light-harvesting complexes* that bind chloroplasts and carotenoids. They absorb light and direct *excitation energy* through the use of *pigment molecules* into *reaction centers*. A pair of special *chlorophyll a* molecules are at the center within the reaction centers. These chlorophylls lose electrons when they absorb excitation energy and as such is a strong *oxidant*, a molecule that gains electrons & is reduced in a chemical reaction. The electrons from the chlorophyll are sent to the *primary electron acceptor*.

Plants have two photosystems connected by an electron transport chain. They reaction move from *photosystem II* to *photosystem I*. It moves protons into the inner membrane, similar to mitochondria, and also produces NADPH which is sent to the Calvin cycle.
