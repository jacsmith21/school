# Lecture 14: Gene Regulation Prokaryotes
Different cells and tissues have different functions. Therefore, they need to express different genes. Furthermore, these requirements are constantly changing. Gene regulation is what maintains the genes that are expressed.

## Location of Regulation
Gene regulation occurs at several levels of gene expression.

### Genes
* Chromatin Packing
* Transcription initiation

### RNA
* RNA Stability
* RNA Processing
* Translation Initiation
* Translation Termination

### Polypeptide
* Protein modification
* Protein Stability / Activation

## Biochemical Pathways
Synthesis or degradation of cellular substances usually requires several steps. A substance may use several enzymes before it becomes the final product. A *biological pathway* is a series of actions among molecules in a cell that leads to a certain product or change within the cell. These enzymes must be present at the same time, meaning all the genes that encode these proteins must be turned on.

## Operons
The term *operon* is used to describe the promoter, operator and gene(s); however, they do not include the *regulatory gene*. Genes that encode proteins in a common pathway often cluster together so that they can be expressed by one promoter. For example, a transport protein and a degradation enzyme may be located one after the other on a chromosome. Each will have it's own AUG and STOP codons. These are known as *transcriptional* units.

*Operons* enable coordinated gene expressions through the use of clustering and *regulatory proteins*. They bind to certain sequences in the promoter. Together, they control access of RNA polymerase to the promoter. These proteins can be controlled by small molecules. *Allosteric proteins* have two different shapes which can be altered by the addition of a small molecule. This characteristic can be used to alter it's function and prevent certain substrates from binding.

### Repressor
*Repressors* block RNA polymerase II from binding with the promoter. The repressor is synthesized by the upstream *regulatory gene*.

For example, consider the tryptophan operon. When tryptophan is available, *tryptophan*, a *corepressor*, binds with a repressor protein to activate it. The trp operon is usually ON.

Furthermore, consider the *lac operon*. When lactose is present, the *Î²-galactosidase* enzyme and the *permease* transport protein need to be produced. The lac operon is usually OFF. Therefor, the repressor *Lacl* is initially active. It binds to the operon *lacO* at two points and overlaps the lacZYA promoter to prevent transcription. The repressor is inactivated by *allolactose*, an *inducer*.

### Activator
*Activators* facilitate the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoters (they increase *affinity*).

Again, consider the *lac operon*. When glucose is present, the operon should still be OFF. This is done through the use of activator proteins which *positively regular operons*. The lac operon is positively regulated by the *CAP protein* (*catabolite activate protein*). This protein only binds with the lac operon when *cAMP* is present (*cAMP* activates the *CAP protein*) and *cAMP* is only present when glucose is scarce. The *cAMP-CAP* combination binds to DNA near the lac promoter and interacts with RNA polymerase.

## Corepressors & Inducers
These are often substrates or products of the pathways they control.
