## Lecture 1: The Cell
The *cell* is the fundamental unit of life. They can exists as independently or as multi-cellular organisms.  

### Types of Cells
There are domains that all cells are apart of. These categories are *eukaryotic cells* and *prokaryotic cells* which are differentiated by the presence of a nucleus and other membrane-enclosed organlles (ex. mitochondria) in prokaryotes.

### Internal Environment
All cells regulate their internal environment to suit them best. *Homeostasis* is the tendency to resist change in order to maintain this preferred state. They can detect changes to their environment and control the flow of molecules across their membrane.

### Energy
Cells are able to obtain nutrients from their environment. The use *catabolic reactions* to break components down into energy (ex. glucose) and *anabolic reactions* to create compounds (ex. insulin). These reactions are what is known as *metabolism*.

Prokaryotes make use of their cell membrane and cytoplasm to conduct metabolic reactions. In eukaryotes, these reactions occur at the mitochondria and chloroplasts.

### Genetic Information & Evolution
Each cell can only arise from other cells through a process called *replication*. During this process, key aspects of cells are passed on such as the genetic information stored in their *DNA*.

Populations of cells evolve through the use of *mutations* in the DNA. These may increase the cells tendency to survive and reproduce.

In prokaryotes, DNA is not enclosed in a membrane but is usually found in the nucleoid along with DNA related proteins. Within eukaryotes, *chromosomes*, the genetic storage devices, are located within the *nucleus*, a membrane enclosed organelle. Within the nucleus, *chromatin* is composed of the chromosomes and *histones*, *nuclear pores* line the membrane (called *nuclear envelope*) and the nucleolus contains a dense formation of *ribonucleic acids* (RNA) & other related proteins.

### Membranes
*Cell membranes* provide a barrier between the internal and external environments. Prokaryotes sometimes has multiple membranes whereas Eukaryotes have one cell membranes; however, Eukaryotes make use of an extensive internal membrane system. This system compartmentalizes certain functions into *organelles* (ex. Vacuole, Golgi apparatus). Each compartment is able to maintain its own optimal conditions allowing it to support specialized functions.

These membranes also allow for the specialized communication and transportation to take place. With use of *transport proteins* and *receptor proteins* (ex. *Fimbriae* allow bacteria to recognize their eukaryotic hosts), cells are able to control the flow of molecules and respond to changes in their external environment. In multicellular organisms, communication can also take place through the use of physical contact (ex. *Gap Junctions* are channels between cells to transport small molecules).

### Transportation
The *cytoskeleton* provides a sort of structure to eukaryotic cells and is involved in *cell motility*. It is often used by motor proteins to transport organelles and *vesicles*.

### Protein Synthesis
DNA carries the information necessary to synthesize proteins, which occurs on the *ribosomes*. The small organelles are located in the *cytosol*, the soluble section of cell, and are called free ribosomes. The other location they are found is bound to the *endoplasmic reticulum*, the membrane located in the *cytoplasm* responsible for protein and lipid synthesis, creating the *rough emdoplasmic reticulum*. The majority of proteins created by these ribosomes are transported outside the cell.

After synthesis, some proteins are transported to the Golgi for further processing. The *golgi apparatus* consists of stacks on membrane enclosed stacks called *cisternae*. It receives vesicles from the ER, modifies proteins and moves them to other locations.

## Lecture 2: Chemical Bonds & Organic Molecules
Cells are comprised primarily of water molecules and are based on carbon. This carbon is acquired through the environment (ex. Diet or CO2).

The four classes of molecules are *carbohydrates*, *lipids*, *proteins* and *nucleic acids*.

### Composition
Molecules are formed by *atoms* with specific biological properties. Each atom has a different amount of *protons*, *neutrons* and *electrons*.

The electrons are located around the *nucleus*, which contain the protons and neutrons, in specific orbitals; however, it is the electrons in the outermost shell that determines chemical behaviors. These attributes are what determines how it bonds with other atoms.

### Covalent Bonds
The type of bond is when valence electrons are shared between two atoms. It is a string bond and an atoms capactiy to form covalent bonds is determined by the number of valence electrons.

Carbon is able to form covalent bonds numerous other elements to form *organic molecules*. *Carbon skeletons* are chains of carbons and form the backbone of these molecules. It is able to form four covalent bonds, usually carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.

These bonds are either *polar*, where the electrons are unequally shared, or *nonpolar*, where the electrons are equally shared. C-C and C-H are nonpolar bonds whereas C-O and O-H are not shared equally. The electrons are attracted more to the O, therefore the O is more *electronegative*. When the difference is greater than 0.4, a bond is said to be electronegative.

A *polar molecule* is then defined as a molecule containing polar bonds where the sum of all of the bond's *dipole movement* does not add to 0.

These bonds are often made and broken during biochemical reactions. These reactions are catalyzed by *enzymes*.

### Ionic Bonds
These bonds are formed when unpaired valence electrons are transferred from one atom to the other, creating *ions*. Once the ions are formed, they are able to bind together as they are oppositely charged.

### Hydrogen Bonds
*Hydrogen bonds* are stronger form of Van der Waal bonds. They occur when hydrogen bonds to an atom that strongly attracts the shared electrons (ex. F, O, N) creating partial charges. These types of bonds are especially important between water molecules, in DNA and in proteins.

### Van der Waals Interactions
Van der Waal bonds are weak bonds formed by partial charges that naturally occur as electrons orbit the nuclei. The asymmetry allows atoms to induce partial charges in other molecules and temporarily bond.

### Functional Groups
Functional groups are chemical groups that replace hydrogen on the carbon skeleton. The groups introduce unique properties to the molecule such as shape, interactions and the reactions that it is able to participate in.

1. Hydroxyl Group -OH
2. Carbonyl Group >C=O
3. Carboxyl Group -COOH
4. Amino Group -NH2
5. Phosphate Group -OPO3 ^ 2-
6. Methyl Group -CH3

## Lectcure 3: Water
Water makes up around 80% of a cell's weight. All of life's necessary reactions take place in water and it is a universal solvent. It is the medium in which biological molecules are able to move through the cell and it influences their shape.

Water is very sticky due to it's ability to form hydrogen bonds. The interaction of these molecules together is unique due to the unique structure of water.

Some definitions:
A *solution* is a homogenous mixture of two or more substances.
A *solute* is the substance that dissolves
A *solvent* is the dissolving agent
An *aqueous solution* is a solution in which water is the solvent

### Properties
Water has many characteristics that are necessary for life such as:
1. Cohesiveness (it's sticky due to it's hydrogen bonds)
2. Ability to moderate temperature (it can store a lot of heat with its hydrogen bonds and act as a buffer)
3. Versatile solvent (it is act as a solvent for all polar molecules)


### Hydrophilic & Hydrophobic Substances
A *hydrophilic substance* is a substance that is able to form hydrogen bonds with water. This includes polar substances that which water breaks down.

A *hydrophobic substance* is a substance that is not able to form hydrogen bonds with water. A nonpolar molecule is classified as hydrophobic substance. These nonpolar molecules tend to aggregate and cause *hydrophobic interactions* which are very important within membranes and proteins.

### Acids & Bases
Water dissociates into ions (H+ and OH-) at a concentration of 10^-7 M each which is the definition nonacidic and nonbasic.

*Acids* are defined as molecules that donate a hydrogen ion whereas *bases* are defined as molecules that donate hydroxyl ions or accept hydrogen ions in aqueous solutions.

The *pH scale* is used to measure acidity and defined as pH = -log[H+]. Solutes alter the pH of a solution.

*Organic acids* are commonly *carboxylic acids* (ex. lactic acid) which are weak acids that do not completly dissociate in water.

*Organic bases* are commonly *amines* (contain amino group) as they accept protons.

## Lecture 4: Carbohydrates
All biological structures are base up of the same building blocks. Larger molecules, *polymers*, are composed of smaller similar molecules called *monomers* through the use of covalent bonds.

Structure determines function.

There are four main groups of macromolecules:
1. Carbohydrates
2. Lipids
3. Nucleic Acids
4. Proteins

### Creating & Destroying Polymers
*Polymerization* is the synthesis of polymers. These reactions are called *condensation reactions* (or *dehydration reactions*) as they take place between an OH and H and form H2O when complete. They are catalyzed by enzymes.

*Depolymerization* is the breakdown of polymers. These reactions are called *dehydration reactions* as they use H2O during the reaction. They are also catalyzed by enzymes.

### What are Carbs
*Carbohydrates* are the sugars and starches and are used to store energy and for cell to cell communication. A *monosaccharide* is a carbohydrate monomer which are also known as the simple sugars. *Glucose*, a 6 carbon sugar, is the most common monosaccharide and exists in both a linear and ring form.

Other monosaccharides include *Ribose*, *Galactose*, *Ribulose* and *Fructose*. They exist as either *Aldehydes*, organic compounds with a carbonyl group is at end, or *Ketones*, where the carbonyl group is in the middle of the structure. An *Aldose* is an aldehyde sugar and a *ketose* is a ketone sugar.

A *disaccharide* is a compound composed of 2 monosaccharides linked by a covalent bond called a *glyosidic bond* which is the bond formed by the dehydration reactions. These disaccharides differ in the monosaccharides involved and the location of the bonded carbon.

*Polysaccharides* are simply carbohydrate polymers formed by multiple dehydration reactions, similar to disaccharides. They act as energy storage capabilities and structural molecules for cells.

### Carbohydrate Structures
*α glucose structures* and *β glucose structures* differ only by the orientation of the hydroxyl on the first carbon. The α structure features the hydroxyl on the bottom whereas the β structure features the hydroxyl on the top. *Starch* and *glycogen* is defined as a 1-4 linkage of α glucose monomers and *cellulose* is defined as a 1-4 linkage of β glucose monomers.

*Amylose* is a plant starch which acts as energy storage. Glycogen, although not a starch, is often referred to as an animal starch and also acts as an energy storage structure. Cellulose, used as plant cell walls, and *chitin*, used by insects for exoskeleton and for fungal walls, are both structural polysaccharides.

Although humans cannot degrade cellulose, bacteria and fungi produce *celluloses* that are able to break it down. Polysaccharides are often used by bacteria as a cover around their cell walls.

### Carbohydrate Communication
Sugar (*glycan*) chains on the surface of cells are often used for intercellular communication. They can be linked covalently to the membrane (*glycolipids*) or to membrane bound proteins called *glycoproteins*.

Different glycosidic linkages are possible as there many hydroxyl groups and two possible orientations. Vast amounts of *oligosaccharides* and polysaccharides can thus be built for communication purposes, in both linear and branched structures.

This superb ability allows for intermolecular recognition and glycan binding protein recognition. One example is of H.pylori, a protein which binds to an oligosaccharide through the use of hydrogen bonds.

## Lecture 5: Lipids
*Lipids* are nonpolar molecules composed of hydrocarbons so are also hydrophobic. The types of lipids are *fats and oils*, *steroids* and phospholipids. They are also as energy storage devices and as the structural components of cell membranes.

### Fatty Acids
*Fatty Acids*, also known as monocarboxylic acids are hydrocarbons of varying length; however, the longer chains are more insoluble in water.

*Saturated fatty acids* contain only carbons that are covalently bonded with 4 atoms. These fats are semisolid at room temperature (think butter). *Unsaturated fatty acids* contain a carbon-carbon double bond and are liquid at room temperature (think oil). *Cis fats* have both hydrogens the same side of the double bond whereas the *trans fats* feature the hydrogen on opposite sides. Trans fats increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and increases the *LDL*/*HDL* ratio. Both of these are lipoproteins which transport lipids in the blood. LDL stands for low density lipoproteins which deliver lipids to cell whereas HDL stands for high density lipoproteins which remove excess lipids back to the liver. LDL is able to enter the artery lining and attract white blood cells and cholesterol resulting in plaque formation. This is known as *atherosclerosis*, the narrowing of the arteries.

*Glycerides* are formed through the bond between *glycerol* and a fatty acid. These compounds are linked through dehydration reactions with an *ester linkage*. *Triglycerides* are simply one glycerol bonded to 3 fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acid chains disrupt the Van der Waals interactions. These are used as energy storage mechanisms and stored in *adipocytes*, fat storing cells, under the skin.

*Hydrogenation* is the process of solidifying oils. This process involves heating the oils and infusing H2 which converts unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. Another side effect is the rearrangement of double bonds to their trans form.

### Steroids
*Steroids* act as regulatory hormones and control development, behavior and other biochemical processes. They vary by the position of carbon-carbon double bonds, substituents (such as hydroxyl, carbonyl and methyl groups) and length & structure of side chains. Examples include *cholesterol*, *vitamin D2*, cortisol, *estradiol* and *testosterone*. Small changes between the sex hormones result in very big differences in secual structure and behavior.

### Phospholipids
*Phospholipids* contain a hydrophilic head, containing a phosphate group and glycerol, with 2 fatty acid chains with hydrophobic tails. This molecule is therefore *amphipathic*, meaning it is both hydrophobic and hydrophilic at the same time.

## Lecture 6: Membranes
*Membranes* serve as a selectively permeable barrier, a protein anchor and a way to create a charge gradient. The membrane is a lipid bilayer made up of non-stationary phospholipids. Animal cells also contain cholesterol, another amphipathic molecule to hinder packing together.

### The Proteins
The membrane contains either *peripheral proteins*, proteins on the surface, or *integral proteins* (also known as *transmembrane proteins*), proteins that span the membrane.

The integral proteins contains hydrophobic regions on the inside and hydrophilic regions on the outside of the membrane. These proteins are transporters, receptors, enzymes and anchors.

1. *Transmembrane receptors* act as attachment sites for cells, viruses and molecules to recognize, communication and signal transduction.
2. *Transmembrane enzymes* are involved in numerous function such as energy metabolism.
3. *Membrane transport proteins* allow molecules that are not able to permeate the cell wall to enter the membrane. Whereas nonpolar molecules can pass through the hydrophobic core in *passive diffusion* down the *concentration gradient*, polar and ionic molecules must use *channel proteins* or *carrier proteins* to pass through.

### Osmosis
*Osmosis* is the diffusion of water and is a special case of passive diffusion. An *isotonic solution* is a solution where there is no net movement of water. When the external environment has a higher solute concentration relative to the internal environment, the net flow is towards the external environment. This solution is called a *hypertonic solution*.

### Facilitated Diffusion
Specific transport proteins are able to increase the rate of diffusion by moving solutes into the cytoplasm, this is called *facilitated diffusion*. This can occur through the use of channel proteins or carrier proteins (which change shape when the solute binds).

### Active transport
*Active transport* is the act of moving solutes against their concentration gradient and often requires energy, such as ATP.

### Bulk Transport
Through the use of vesicle, large amount of substances can be removed when *exocytosis* occurs (a vesicle fuses with the cell wall). This process is called *bulk transport*. For example, this is used by neurons when they use synaptic vesicles to release neurotransmitter molecules. *Endocytosis* is used as a way to transport large amounts of substances into the cell (mediated by proteins).
