# Lecture 23: Eukaryotic Cytoskeleton
The **cytoskeleton** is composed of intermediate protein fibers called **filaments**, **microfilaments** and **microtubules**.

The cytoskeleton determines cell shape, is key to cell division and aids in cell **motility** (the ability for the cell to move itself spontaneously while consuming energy).

## Microfilaments
The key component of **microfilaments** (also known as **actin filaments**) is a protein called **actin**. **Actin** monomers (**actin filaments**) polymerize into two interwound filaments. These are the narrowest cytoskeleton fiber. They are also directional. The grow at the + end using ATP.

Actin serves as the tract for the **motor protein** called **myosin** within the cell. A ring made of actin pinches the cell apart during division. Actin can also assemble / disassemble quickly which is important for **cell motility** (especially crawling). Finally, actin is important in the structure of the cell.

Functions:
* Microvilli
* Cytoplasmic contractile bundles
* Pseudopods / cell shape
* Cell division

Amoeba also uses microfilaments use crawl over surfaces. Furthermore, they are used for cytoplasmic streaming.

## Intermediate Filaments
**Intermediate filaments** (**IF**) are another cytoskeleton made up of multiple strands of interwound fibrous proteins. The components depend on the type of cell (skin cells IF are made up of **keratin**). Proteins assemble into filaments which assemble into supercoiled cables.

Intermediate filaments provide cell strength, resist tension, anchor cell components and provide cell adhesion.

A protein resulting from the **gigaxonin gene** is required for recycling and degradation of the intermediate filaments.

## Microtubules
**Microtubules** are made up of α & β-tublin (one after the other). It is a hollow structure made up of 13 tubline filaments. Like microfilaments, microtubules also have directionality and can grow and shrink quickly.

**Microtubules** provide structural support, provide tracks for **Kinesins** and **dyneins** which transport vesicles (and other stuff) around the interior of the cell. Most importantly, microtubules assemble into a structure known as a **spindle** to pull the Dichotomiser apart.

**Microtubules** also play key roles for the structure of:
- **Flagella**
- **Cilia**
- **Centrosomes**

## Centrosomes
**Centrosomes** are little balls with two **centrioles** inside. They have numerous pores which the - end of the microtubule anchors itself to.

## Motor Proteins
**Motor proteins** function in:
- Movement of the organelles
- Movement of macromolecules
- Contraction
- Amoeboid movements

They use ATP for walking along the cytoskeleton.

**Kinesins** walk from - to +. **Dyneins** walk from + to -. They all contain ATPase feet and "cargo" binding location.

## Learning Objective
The cytoskeleton is a diverse network of protein
fibers that organizes structures and activities in the
cell. The cytoskeleton is a dynamic, constantly
changing structure.
• Know the different components of the cytoskeleton
and understand their composition, assembly and
function.
• Know the key protein classes involved in actively
moving vesicles and organelles in the cell, where
they get their energy, and the mechanism of action.

# Lecture 24: Cell Cycle
Phases:
- G0: Resting
- G1: Cell Growth & normal metabolism
- S: Synthesis phase (replication of chromosomes)
- G2: Growth and preparation for cell division
- M: mitotic phase

## Interphase
Includes G1, S, G2.

### G1 Phase
** Cell grows larger
** Organelles are copied
** Create the molecular building blocks they will need later

### S Phase
- Chromosome move apart
- Chromosomes duplicate
- Chromosomes are pulled apart into two cells

### G2 Phase
- Similar to G1
- Centrosomes are formed (sometimes in S phase)
- Reorganization occurs

## M Phase
Includes **prophase**, **metaphase**, **anaphase** and **telophase**.

### Prophase
Chromosomes condense and **mitotic spindle** forms

### Prometaphase
Fragmentation of the nuclear envelope and microtubules attach to the newly formed **kinetochore** (located at the **centromere** of chromosomes).

The nuclear envelope is pulled apart by the dynein motors on the MT of the centrosomes. The **lamina** pulls away (dense fibrillary network inside the nucleus) and the remnants float around the centrosomes are migrate to the ER.

### Metaphase
Chromosomes align in the middle at the **metaphase plate** and the centrosomes go to the opposite ends.

### Anaphase
Separation of the sister **chromatids**. The cell elongates.

### Telophase
- Nuclear envelope reforms
- **Cleavage furrow** forms between separated cells

## Kinetochore & Microtubules
**Kinetochores** are proteins which attach to chromosomes to act as attachment points for MT. Chromatids will move along the MT to the ends of the cell. **Non-kinetochore microtubules** overlap and allow motor proteins to walk along the opposite microtubule and elongate the cell.

## Cytokinesis
This occurs at the metaphase plate. A ring made of MF and the myosin motor protein contract and forms a cleavage furrow.

## Cell Checkpoints
- G1 checkpoint: Cell big enough? Enough nutrients? DNA damage?
- G2 checkpoint: DNA replication complete? DNA damage? Cell big enough?
- M checkpoint: Spindle checkpoint

The cell may be able to repair itself or it will undergo **apoptosis**.

## Cyclin / CDK
**Cyclin-dependant kinases** (**CDK**) is present throughout the cell cycle but not active. CDK is activated by binding specific cyclin. The concentration of cyclin varies according to stage of the cell cycle. It increases before checkpoints and decreases after passing. It is a molecular mechanism to regulate the cell cycle.

**Maturation promoting factor** is a protein that turns itself by activating the anaphase-promoting complex.

## Learning Objective
Know and understand the general process of the cell
cycle, mitosis and cell division. Stages and what is
happening at these stages.
• Movement of chromosomes during mitosis requires
microtubules and motor proteins. Understand how
this works.
• Understand the role of microfilaments and myosin in
the function of the contractile ring and cytokinesis
• Understand the role of cyclins and CDK’s in
regulating the cell cycle.

# Lecture 25: Stem  Cells
Stem cells have the ability to renew themselves. They have escaped the **Hayflick limit**. They are unspecialized, undifferentiated cells.

## Hiarchy
1. Totipotent: Can give rise to embryo/placental & body cells
2. Pluripotent: Can give rise to any body cells
3. Multipotent: Blood, muscle, nerve, bone and other tissue stem cells.

## Embryonic Stem Cells
**Embryonic stem cells** are from a 5 day pre-implantation stage embryo. The code from the inner cells of the **Blastocyst** (which form the body cells) and are **pluripotent**.

They form the:
- **Endoderm**: Gut/liver/Lung (inside stuff)
- **Mesoderm**: Muscle, blood, bone
- **Ectoderm**: Brain & skin
- **Germline**: Sperm & Egg

## Adult (Somatic) Stem Cells
Rare cells located in different tissues. They are **multipotent**. They are important for regeneration and repair of functions.

### Skeletal Stem Cells (Satellite Cells)
There are two types of division:
- Symmetrical: Stem cells generates another stem cell
- Asymmetrical: Stem cells produces precursor cell (differentiation)

## Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
Adult differentiated stem cells -> stem cell (**de-differentiation**). Induced by infecting skin cells with retrovirus containing stem cell master regulatory genes.

They could be used as treatments.

## Learning Objective
Understand	the	different	types	of	stem	cells	and	their
potential	in	terms	of	differentiation.
• Understand	the	function	of	adult	stem	cells? How	do	they
differentiate?	How	are	they	able	to	remain	in	the
undifferentiated	state?
• Understand	the	applications	(potential)	of	stem	cells	in
research	and	health

# Lecture 26: Sexual Reproduction
Includes two parents passing half of their genes to their offspring. **Meiosis** halves the chromosome number to produce gametes. Sexual reproduction increases genetic **variation**.

## Process
### Interphase
1. Chromosomes condense and separate.
2. Chromosomes replicate and pair with their sister chromatids (using **cohesins** to bind) and form **tetrads**.
3. Crossing over occurs at **chiasmata** (site of crossing over) when sisters cross-over with their pairs.

### Meiosis I
3. Homologous chromos separate such that the sister chromatids stay attached.

### Meiosis II
4. Sister chromatids separate into two individual cells

## Genetic Variation
1. Independent Assortment: Which chromosomes go to which cells is random (223 = 8,388,608)
2. Crossing over in Prophase 1 increases variation.
3. Random Fertilization: There are a lot of possibilities

## Key Words
* **Somatic Cell**: any cell other than a gamete
* **Fertilization**: union of gametes to produce a zygote

## Learning Objective
Offspring acquire genes from their parents by inheriting
chromosomes
• Meiosis reduces the number of chromosome sets by half
• Sexual reproduction produces genetic variation by the
independent assortment of chromosomes at
Metaphase I, crossing over in Prophase, and by random
fusion of gametes
• Genetic variation contributes to evolution and faster
adaptation to environmental change

# Lecture 27: Mendel
Concepts:
- Allele
- Dominance
- True Breeding
- Mono and Di-hybrid cross
- genotype
- phenotype

## Experiments
- Character: A heritable feature
- Trait: Variation of a character
- Phenotype: The physical appearance of a character

## Law of Segregation
Alleles randomly segregate into gametes. Mendel used **monohybrid cross** (corrsing parents who differ by one trait). Mendel also used **dihybrid cross** (crossing parents who differ by two traits).

## Incomplete Dominance
Heterozygotes have intermediate phenotype.

## Law of Independant Assortment
Mendel used dihybrid cross to show that genes for differing characters assort independently of each other.

# Lecture 28: Asexual Reproduction
One parent, each offspring is genetically identical, rare for multicellular organisms but common for unicellular organisms.

## Unicellular
1. Binary Fission: Symetrical division
2. Budding: Assymmetrical division followed by growth

## Multicellular
1. Vegatative Reproduction
2. Parthenogenesis: Egg develops without fertilization. This occurs through meiosis. The chromosomes double twice to form 8 chromosoems. The cell divides but only one is used in the embryo stage. The others are **polar bodies**.

## Why does Asexual Reproduction Work?
Organisms may use **gene conversion** to accumulate favourable genes or to eliminate detrimental mutations.
