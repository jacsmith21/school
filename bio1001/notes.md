## Lecture 1: The Cell
The *cell* is the fundamental unit of life. They can exists as independantly or as multi-cellular organisms.  

### Types of Cells
There are domains that all cells are apart of. These catagories are *eukaryotic cells* and *prokaryotic cells* which are differentiated by the presence of a nucleus and other membrane-enclosed organlles (ex. mitochondria) in prokaryotes.

### Internal Environment
All cells regulate their internal environment to suit them best. *Homeostasis* is the tendency to resist change in order to maintain this preferred state. They can detect changes to their environment and control the flow of molecules across their membrane.

### Energy
Cells are able to obtain nutrients from their environment. The use *catabolic reactions* to break components down into energy (ex. glucose) and *anabolic reactions* to create componds (ex. insulin). These reactions are what is known as *metabolism*.

Prokaryotes make use of their cell membrane and cytoplasm to conduct metabolic reations. In eukaryotes, these reactions occur at the mitochondira and choloplasts.

### Genetic Information & Evolution
Each cell can only arise from other cells through a process called *replication*. During this process, key aspects of cells are passed on such as the genetic information stored in their *DNA*.

Populations of cells evolve through the use of *mutations* in the DNA. These may increase the cells tendency to survive and reproduce.

In prokaryotes, DNA is not enclosed in a membraine but is usually found in the nucleoid along with DNA related proteins. Within eukaryotes, *chromosomes*, the genetic storage devices, are located within the *nucleus*, a membrane enclosed organelle. Within the necleus, *chromatin* is composed of the chromosomes and *histones*, *nuclear pores* line the membrane (called *nuclear envelope*) and the nucleolus contains a dense formation of *ribonucleic acids* (RNA) & other related proteins.

### Membranes
*Cell membranes* provide a barrier between the internal and external environments. Prokaryotes sometimes has multiple membranes whereas Eukaryotes have one cell membreans; however, Eukaryotes make use of an extensive internal membrane system. This system compartmentalizes certain functions into *organelles* (ex. Vacuole, Golgi apparatus). Each compartment is able to maintain its own optimal conditions allowing it to support specialized functions.

These membranes also allow for the specialized communication and transportation to take place. With use of *transport proteins* and *receptor proteins* (ex. *Fimbriae* allow bacteria to recognize their eukaryotic hosts), cells are able to control the flow of molecules and respond to changes in their external environment. In multicellular organisms, communication can also take place through the use of physical contact (ex. *Gap Junctions* are channels between cells to transport small molecules).

### Transportation
The *cytoskeleton* provides a sort of structure to eukaryotic cells and is involved in *cell motility*. It is often used by motor proteins to transport organelles and *vesicles*.

### Protein Synthesis
DNA carries the information neccessary to synthesize proteins, which occurs on the *ribosomes*. The small organelles are located in the *cytosol*, the soluble section of cell, and are called free ribosomes. The other location they are found is bound to the *endoplasmic reticulum*, the membrane located in the *cytoplasm* reponsible for protein and lipid synthesis, creating the *rough emdoplasmic reticulum*. The majority of proteins created by these ribosomes are transported outside the cell.

After synthesis, some proteins are transported to the golgi for furthur processing. The *golgi apparatus* consists of stacks on membrane enclosed stacks called *cisternae*. It receives vesicles from the ER, modifies proteins and moves them to other locations.

## Lecture 2: Chemical Bonds & Organic Molecules
Cells are comprised primarily of water molecues and are based on carbon. This carbon is aquired through the environment (ex. Diet or CO2).

The four classes of molcules are *carbohydrates*, *lipids*, *proteins* and *nucleic acids*.

### Composition
Molecules are formed by *atoms* with specific biological properties. Each atom has a different amount of *protons*, *neutrons* and *electrons*.

The electrons are located around the *nucleus*, which contain the protons and neutrons, in specific orbitals; however, it is the electrons in the outermost shell that determines chemical behaviors. These attributes are what determines how it bonds with other atoms.

### Covalent Bonds
The type of bond is when valence electrons are shared between two atoms. It is a string bond and an atoms capactiy to form covalent bonds is determined by the number of valence electrons.

Carbon is able to form covalent bonds numerous other elements to form *organic molecules*. *Carbon skeletons* are chains of carbons and form the backbone of these molecules.

These bonds are either *polar*, where the electrons are unequally shared, or *nonpolar*, where the electrons are equally shared. C-C and C-H are nonpolar bonds whereas C-O and O-H are not shared equally. The electrons are attracted more to the O, therefore the O is more *electronegative*.
