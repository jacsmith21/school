# Lecture 7: Proteins
Proteins have many functions and are fundamental aspects of the cell.

## The Building Blocks
For proteins, the monomers are the *amino acids* and the polymers are called *peptides*, *polypeptides* and *proteins*. The groups that exists on an amino acid is an amino and carboxyl groups. The aspect that distinguishes the amino acid is the *side chain* such as hydrocarbons, oxygen's, carboxyl groups and amino groups.
