# Lecture 7: Proteins
Proteins have many functions and are fundamental aspects of the cell.

## The Building Blocks
For proteins, the monomers are the *amino acids* and the polymers are called *peptides*, *polypeptides* and *proteins*.  

## Structure of Amino Acid
The structure of an amino acid contains an amino, carboxyl and R groups. The aspect that distinguishes one amino acid from another is the *side chain* (the R group) which consist of hydrocarbons, oxygen's, carboxyl groups or other amino groups.

## Types of Amino Acids
There are 20 types of *amino acids*, which only differ in the R group. These groups are somtimes hydrophobic, hydrophilic or carry a charge at the cellular pH.

Hydrophobic amino acids have non polar side chains such as H or CH3.  Hydrophilic amino acids have polar side chains such as CH2-OH or CH2-SH. Some of the hydrophilic groups also have electrically charged side chains such as Aspartic Acid or Lysine.

## Bonds
The polymerization of amino acids include the formation of *peptide bonds*. This reaction involves the amino group on one amino acid and the carboxyl group on the other. Similiar to carbohydrates, this reaction is also a dehydration reaction. This reaction occurs on the ribosome.

A *tripeptide* is three amino acids covalently bonded together. This molecule is divided has two sections named the *backbone* and *side chains*.

## Structure of Proteins
There are four levels of protein structure.

1. *Primary Stucture*: The sequence of amino acids. There is an amino end and a carboxyl end.
2. *Secondary Structure*: The coils and folds between the polypeptide chains as a result of the H bonds between the backbone atoms. The α helices are flexible whereas the β sheets are rigid. As a result, proteins can form *alpha helix* or *pleated sheets*. Some toxic proteins may go through α helix to β sheet transition.  
3. *Tertiary Structure*: The coils and folds between the polypeptide chains as a result of the interactions amoung the various R groups. The interactions stabilize the tertiary structure of the protein through the user of all kinds of bonds. One special example is the *disulfide bridge* which occurs between cysteins during oxidation reactions.
4. *Quaternary Structure*: When a protein consists of multiple polypeptide chains. Two or more polypeptide groups (subunits) may interact. For example, this may create fibrous proteins .....

## Functional Groups
Protein structure can be modified by the addition of functional groups. For example, a phosphate group can be added to the R group through the use of a covalent bond. This introduces a negatively charged functional group which changes the shape (and function) of the protein.
