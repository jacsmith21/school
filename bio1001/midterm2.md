# Lecture 7: Proteins
Proteins have many functions and are fundamental aspects of the cell.

## The Building Blocks
For proteins, the monomers are the *amino acids* and the polymers are called *peptides*, *polypeptides* and *proteins*.  

## Structure of Amino Acid
The structure of an amino acid contains an amino, carboxyl and R groups. The aspect that distinguishes one amino acid from another is the *side chain* (the R group) which consist of hydrocarbons, oxygen's, carboxyl groups or other amino groups.

## Types of Amino Acids
There are 20 types of *amino acids*, which only differ in the R group. These groups are sometimes hydrophobic, hydrophilic or carry a charge at the cellular pH.

Hydrophobic amino acids have non polar side chains such as H or CH3.  Hydrophilic amino acids have polar side chains such as CH2-OH or CH2-SH. Some of the hydrophilic groups also have electrically charged side chains such as Aspartic Acid or Lysine.

## Bonds
The polymerization of amino acids include the formation of *peptide bonds*. This reaction involves the amino group on one amino acid and the carboxyl group on the other. Similar to carbohydrates, this reaction is also a dehydration reaction. This reaction occurs on the ribosome.

A *tripeptide* is three amino acids covalently bonded together. This molecule is divided has two sections named the *backbone* and *side chains*.

## Structure of Proteins
There are four levels of protein structure.

1. *Primary Stucture*: The sequence of amino acids. There is an amino end and a carboxyl end.
2. *Secondary Structure*: The coils and folds between the polypeptide chains as a result of the H bonds between the backbone atoms. The α helices are flexible whereas the β sheets are rigid. As a result, proteins can form *alpha helix* or *pleated sheets*. Some toxic proteins may go through α helix to β sheet transition.  
3. *Tertiary Structure*: The coils and folds between the polypeptide chains as a result of the interactions among the various R groups. The interactions stabilize the tertiary structure of the protein through the user of all kinds of bonds such as hydrogen/ionic bonds and hydrophobic/van der Waals interactions. One special example is the *disulfide bridge* which occurs between cysteine during oxidation reactions.
4. *Quaternary Structure*: When a protein consists of multiple polypeptide chains. Two or more polypeptide groups (subunits) may interact. For example, this may create fibrous proteins such as *collagen* or globular proteins such as *hemoglobin*.

## Functional Groups
Protein structure can be modified by the addition of functional groups. For example, a phosphate group can be added to the R group through the use of a covalent bond. This introduces a negatively charged functional group which changes the shape (and function) of the protein.

## How is Structure Determined?
Proteins structure is determined experimentally through methods such as *x-ray crystallography* and *nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy*. Tertiary structure may also be predicted from the primary structure.

The structure is influenced by factors such as pH, salt concentration and temperature.

*Denaturation* is the destruction of the weak bonds and interactions that maintain the 3D structure and leads to an inactive protein called *denatured proteins*. *Renaturation* is the opposite process.

# Lecture 8: Getting to Know Proteins Better
Each protein has a unique shape (tertiary structure) that determines function. The shape is determined by the primary structure and the side chains of amino acids determine the interactions that occur within proteins.

## Proteins & Disease
The misfolding of proteins leads to many neurodegenerative diseases such as *Alzheimer's disease*, *Huntington's disease*, *Parkinson's disease* and *prion diseases*. The risk factor increases with age due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins that aggregate. These proteins damage the nerves.

### Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's is a degenerative brain disorder. An individual who has this disease has a progressive loss of abstract thinking and memory. During the onset, misfolded *amyloid* proteins (*β-amyloid* protein) begin to aggregate to form *amyloid plaques*.

*Amyloid-β precursor proteins* (*APP*) are transmembrane proteins in nerve cells which normally act as signal receptors involved in neural growth and repair.

The *cleavage* of APP molecules, cut by *proteases*, changes during the onset of the disease. This abnormal cleavage produces neurotoxic Aβ peptides (40-23 amino acids) which aggregate to form amyloid plaques.

Most cases of Alzheimer's are not inherited; however, some forms of the disease can be inherited. For example, the amino acid at position 22 of the peptide may be G instead of E which creates a peptide called *Aβ22G*.

# Lecture 9: Nucleic Acids
There are two types of *nucleic acids* including:
* *Deoxyribonucleic acid* (*DNA*)
* *Ribonucleic Acid* (*RNA*)

The functions of DNA including the storage of hereditary information and to act as protein blueprints. The functions of RNA include the transmission of instructions for making proteins, regulating the synthesis of proteins and helping directly in the synthesis of proteins. The flow of genetic information is DNA -> mRNA -> Protein with help of *Transfer RNA* (*tRNA*), *Ribosomal RNA* (*rRNA*) and *Regulatory RNA*.

## Structure
The monomers of nucleic acids include *nucleotides*. The nucleotide includes a varying amounts of phosphate groups, a pentose sugar and *nitrogenous base*. The sugar and base together are called the *nucleoside*. The full structure name will vary depending on the number of phosphate groups, such as *nucleoside monophosphate* and *nucleoside triphosphate*.

Within the sugars, DNA contains a *deoxyribose sugar* with two hydrogens on the 2' carbon whereas RNA contains a *ribose sugar* with on OH on the bottom. The phosphate group attaches to the 5' carbon on the sugar. The OH on the 3' carbon is used for the polymerization of nucleotides. This means the growing point is the 3' carbon and the *directionality* is 5'->3'.

Polymerization is completed through the use of dehydration reactions catalyzed by *DNA polymerase* to form *phosphodiester linkages*. During this reaction, the OH of the nucleoside triphosphate of one strand reacts with the OH of the 3' carbon. The OH on the phosphate group is completely removed and the other two phosphate groups break off to form *pyrophosphate*. The polymer of nucleotides are *nucleic acids*.

Nucleic acids have a certain sequence of bases which is how information is stored. This sequence is supported by the *sugar-phosphate backbone* and details the sequence of amino acids in proteins.

RNA is a *single stranded* whereas DNA is *double stranded* (has two antiparallel strands) which allows it to twist around itself to form a *double helix*. Within the double helix, there are *major grooves*, where the backbones from one level to the next are far apart, and *minor grooves*, where they are close together. To create double stranded nucleic acids, hydrogen bonds are used to hold them together. There exists two hydrogen bonds between the A & T and three hydrogen bonds between the C & G.

## Types of Nucleotides
There are five types of nucleotides which differ in their nitrogenous bases.
1. *Cytosine*
2. *Thymine*
3. *Uracil*
4. *Adenine*
5. *Guanine*

Uracil is present on RNA whereas thymine is present on DNA.

## Who Discovered the Structure
*Francis Crick* and *James Watson* were the two who discovered the structure; however,  Rosalind Franklin aided in the discovery. *Erwin Chargaff* created *Chargaff's Rule of Base Pairing* where %A = %T and %C = %G.

## Replication
The structure of DNA is important for easy replication and for the transmission of genetic material. The same sequence of nucleotides is passed on from parent to child. Each strand serves as a template for the construction of a complementary strand.

RNA also has a secondary structure due to *intrastrand base pairing* (it will pair with itself).

## DNA in Prokaryotic Cells
Prokaryotic cells usually have one large circular DNA molecule called a *chromosome*; however, is sometimes several smaller circular DNA molecules called *plasmids*. This DNA is not enclosed within a membrane and is *supercoiled* into a *nucleoid*.

## DNA in Eukaryotic cells
In eukaryotic cells, DNA is found within the nucleus bound to *histone proteins* via charged amino acids to form *chromatin*. DNA that is wound around a histone is called a *nucleosome* which look like beads on a string. The interactions between the nucleosomes create chromatin which coils into fibers. Further looping of the fibers condenses them into *chromosomes*. A *chromatid* is one strand of the chromosome pair. Some regions, called *heterochomatin*, are tightly packed and inactive. Other regions that are less compacted are called *euchromatin* which are active.

## Genes
*Genes* are discrete units of hereditary information. They are specific linear segments of DNA. Each gene occupies a distinct region on the chromosome.
