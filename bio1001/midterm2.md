# Lecture 7: Proteins
Proteins have many functions and are fundamental aspects of the cell.

## The Building Blocks
For proteins, the monomers are the *amino acids* and the polymers are called *peptides*, *polypeptides* and *proteins*.  

## Structure of Amino Acid
The structure of an amino acid contains an amino, carboxyl and R groups. The aspect that distinguishes one amino acid from another is the *side chain* (the R group) which consist of hydrocarbons, oxygen's, carboxyl groups or other amino groups.

## Types of Amino Acids
There are 20 types of *amino acids*, which only differ in the R group. These groups are somtimes hydrophobic, hydrophilic or carry a charge at the cellular pH.

Hydrophobic amino acids have non polar side chains such as H or CH3.  Hydrophilic amino acids have polar side chains such as CH2-OH or CH2-SH. Some of the hydrophilic groups also have electrically charged side chains such as Aspartic Acid or Lysine.

## Bonds
The polymerization of amino acids include the formation of *peptide bonds*. This reaction involves the amino group on one amino acid and the carboxyl group on the other. Similiar to carbohydrates, this reaction is also a dehydration reaction. This reaction occurs on the ribosome.

A *tripeptide* is three amino acids covalently bonded together. This molecule is divided has two sections named the *backbone* and *side chains*.

## Structure of Proteins
There are four levels of protein structure.

1. *Primary Stucture*: The sequence of amino acids. There is an amino end and a carboxyl end.
2. *Secondary Structure*: The coils and folds between the polypeptide chains as a result of the H bonds between the backbone atoms. The α helices are flexible whereas the β sheets are rigid. As a result, proteins can form *alpha helix* or *pleated sheets*. Some toxic proteins may go through α helix to β sheet transition.  
3. *Tertiary Structure*: The coils and folds between the polypeptide chains as a result of the interactions amoung the various R groups. The interactions stabilize the tertiary structure of the protein through the user of all kinds of bonds such as hydrogen/ionic bonds and hydrophobic/van der Waals interactions. One special example is the *disulfide bridge* which occurs between cysteins during oxidation reactions.
4. *Quaternary Structure*: When a protein consists of multiple polypeptide chains. Two or more polypeptide groups (subunits) may interact. For example, this may create fibrous proteins such as *collagen* or globular proteins such as *hemoglobin*.

## Functional Groups
Protein structure can be modified by the addition of functional groups. For example, a phosphate group can be added to the R group through the use of a covalent bond. This introduces a negatively charged functional group which changes the shape (and function) of the protein.

## How is Structure Determined?
Proteins structure is determined experimentatally through methods such as *x-ray crystallography* and *nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy*. Tertiary structure may also be predicted from the primary structure.

The structure is influenced by factors such as pH, salt concentration and temperature.

*Denuration* is the detruction of the weak bonds and interactions that maintain the 3D structure and leads to an inactive protein called *denured proteins*. *Renuration* is the opposite process.

# Lecture 8: Getting to Know Proteins Better
Each protein has a unqiue shape (tertiary structure) that determines function. The shape is determined by the primary structure and the side chains of amino acids determine the interactions that occur within proteins.

## Proteins & Disease
The misfolding of proteins leads to many neurodegenerative diseases such as *alzheimers disease*, *huntingtons disease*, *parkinsons disease* and *prion diseases*. The risk factor increases with age due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins that aggregate. These proteins damage the nerves.

### Alzeimers Disease
Alzeimers is a degenerative brain disorder. An individual who has this disease has a progressive loss of abstract thinking and memory. During the onset, misfoldeed *amyloid* proteins (*β-amyloid* protein) begin to aggregate to form *amyloid plaques*.

*Amyloid-β precursor proteins* (*APP*) are transmembrane proteins in nerve cells which normaly act as signal receptors involved in neural growth and repair.

The *cleavage* of APP molecules, cut by *proeases*, changes during the onset of the disease. This abnormal cleavage produces neurotoxic Aβ peptides (40-23 amino acids) which aggregate to form amyloid plaques.

Most cases of alzeihmers are not inherited; however, some forms of the disease can be inherited. For example, the amino acid at position 22 of the peptide may be G instead of E which creates a peptide called *Aβ22G*.
