# Assignment Report
The report assignment for the assignment.

## Requirements
1. Description of the learning algorithms you implement.  
1. Description of the datasets you use (number of examples, number of attribute, number of classes, type of attributes, etc.).  
1. Technical details of your implementation: pre-processing of dataSet sets (discretization, etc.), parameter setting, etc.  
1. Design of your programming implementation (dataSet structures, overall program structure).  
1. Report and analysis of your experimental results including:
* Compare and discuss your algorithms (implementations) based on your experimental results
* 10 times 5-fold cross-validation, and report the average accuracy and standard deviation
