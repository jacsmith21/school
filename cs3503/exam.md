# Exam
## The Grand Opening
- List of the topics of the course
- List the grade distribution

It is important to find out what people want/need.

We will focus on the traditional SDLC and then agile. We will also look a DevOps.

## Systems Development Environment
- Define information systems analysis and design
- Describe the role of the systems analyst in information systems development

### Information Systems Analysis and Design
- Provides a structure to create/maintain software business systems
- and improve employee efficiency
- Requires analysis and design based on an understanding of the business objectives, structure and processes
- and knowledge of IT (optional but advantageous)

### Life Cycle
- Systems planning and selection
- Systems analysis
- Systems design
- Systems implementation and operating

### Goals
- Improve an organizations system (acquire/develop software, train employees)
- Software should support an organizations function/processes
- System should turn data into usable information using hardware/software, documentation & training, security controls, job roles, participation from employees

### System
- Set of business procedures used within a business for a purpose
- Exists within an environment but has a boundary
- Also has a purpose, constraints, inputs/outputs, interfaces, and related components

### Development Process
- Process for creating these systems
- Consists of methodologies, techniques and tools

### Important Concepts
- Decoupling
- Modularity
- Cohesion
- System integration

### Your Role
- Study organizations problems
- Identify best approach
- Help customers define requirements

## Software Development Life Cycle
- Describe the database SDLC
- List three things that threaten software projects
- List three ways to adapt the SDLC to address the threats

### Two Approaches
- Waterfall (fixed, one cycle, longer planning, comprehensive)
- Prototype (iterative, same steps, define database during the development of the initial prototype, repeat for new prototypes)

### Waterfall
- Planning (enterprise & data modeling, preliminary understanding, request for study)
- Analysis (thorough data modeling, requirements analysis & structuring, programs/data structures & technology purchases &organization redesigns)
- Logical design (logical database design ie. transactions & views & security, develop technology & organization specifications, detailed design specifications)
- Physical design (define database to DBMS & database programs, information requirements elicitation and structure, program/data structures & technology purchases)
- Implementation (programming & documentation, programming & testing & training & documentation, operational programs & documentation)
- Maintenance (database maintenance, repair & monitor, audits)

### Shortcomings
- How does this address change, risk, and confidence?
- Use AGILE!

## Systems Planning & Selection
- Identify the steps in planning & selecting projects
- Explain the purpose of a Systems Request

### Where do ideas come from?
- Managers & business groups, corporate planning units, IT/IS groups
- Could be strategic plans from corporate or improvements at work-group level

### Business Process Managements
- Can be totally new
- OR re-engineer an existing system
- BPR
- BPI

### Systems Request
- Used to evaluate against alternatives
- Identifies sponsor (client, internal business and/or technical unit), business needs, business requirements, business value (tangible vs intangible value), issues and constraints (timeline, regulations)
- Outcomes include rejections, accept, delay, modifications, purchase system, refocus

### Project Initiation & Planning
Activities include:
- Project initiation team
- Customer relationships
- Project initiation plan
- Management procedures
- Environment & workbook
- Describe scope, alternatives, feasibility

#### Feasibility
- Economic
- Political
- Operational
- Technical
- Legal
- Schedule

## Assessing Feasibility
- List and describe feasibility dimensions
- Differentiate between tangible and intangible benefits
- Carry out simple feasibility analysis

### Economic
Should we build it?

- Perform cost/benefit analysis
- Ongoing/one-time costs/benefits
- Look at tangible/intangible economic benefits

#### Tangible
- Error reduction
- Hardware costs
- Increased speed

#### Intangible
- Increased productivity/morale
- Loss of consumer trust

#### Tools
- ROI
- Break even analysis
- NPV

### Other Feasibility
- Operational -> how can new processes fit into the current business processes? Is it strategically aligned?
- Technological -> groups understanding of hardware/software? Can they do it? Is it compatible with existing solutions? Does the group have experience with projects of a similar scope?
- Political -> business politics. Does the project have a champion? Do they have enough power? Are stakeholders blocking the project?
- Schedule -> can it meet deadlines and constraints?
- Legal -> Labour agreements, non-disclosure, anti-trust, privacy, foreign trade legislation. Using contractors may increase risks.

- Procedures and manuals

#### Helpful Characteristics
- Impertinence (question everything)
- Impartiality (reserve judgement & seek understanding)

- Derived from BPP
- Based on functions and rules
- Example: On-boarding new employee

#### Non-functional

- Technical (must use organizations technical infrastructure)
- Performance
- Usability
- Security
- Reliability

## Define & Prioritize Requirements
- Describe three different model types
- Name 3 different graphical modeling techniques
- Build simple DFD

System Requirements gathering is about identifying the key components of the system.

### Models
- Mathematical (formulas, notation). Useful in technical requirements.
- Descriptive (memos, forms, reports, lists). Actors defined in the processes.
- Graphical (processes, flows, system UI). Abstract.

Your arsenal includes:
- Flowcharts
- Activity diagrams
- Use cases

### Data Flow Diagrams
- Traditional method for process modeling
- Different levels of abstraction
- Fundamental elements includes: sources/sinks origin/destination (viewed as external to the system), data flows, data stores, processes (automated/manual manipulation of data)

### Rules
- Connections mean data flow
- Sources/sinks can connect to processes
- Processes can connect to data stores, processes, and oF course sources/sinks

### Levels
- Context level is the highest level (contains level 0 process)
- Level 0 process breaks down into level 0 DFD containing processes 1, 2, 3, 4
- These break down in x1, x2, x3, ...
- At some point, processes can be used a basis for use cases

### Verifying Models
- Need to verify correctness
- Uses cases can help
- Prototyping system UI
- Whatever choice should close feedback loop??

### Prioritizing Requirements
#### Categorizing Requirements
- Not all are equal
- Evaluate requirements against BPP
- Sort into mandatory, important, desirable

## Interviews
- Interpret basic body language
- Plan, conduct and review interview

### Kinesis
- Also known as body language
- Classification of gestures made with the body (facial, posture, breathing, handshakes, movements, gestures)
- Used to read attitude
- Manipulate emotions (feel at ease, get reaction)

### Why Interview
- Natural activity
- Able to gain much more information

### Steps
1. Selecting interviewees (sponsor/key-users can help, develop schedule, start at top and work your way down)
2. Designing questions (close ended, open ended, probing)
3. Preparing for interviews (design the flow, topics, segues, contact interviewees to confirm expertise, set up meeting time, set duration)
3. Conducting interviews (establish rapport, overview the project & their potential contribution, write everything down, always make sure you understand & ask questions if you don't, make time for interviewees to ask questions, explain what happens next)
4. Follow up (prepare report, send back for comments)

### Hazards
- No promises
- Interviewees might not share all they know if they aren't convinced of sincerity, importance.

## Generating & Evaluating Alternatives
No learning objectives.

- Pseudocode

## Crap & Heuristics UI
Contrast
• Avoid having items on a page be similar
• If they are not the same then make them very different

Repetition
• Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece
• i.e. shape, texture, spatial relationships, line thickness, sizes, etc.

Alignment
• Nothing should be arbitrarily placed
• Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page

Proximity
• Items relating to each other should be grouped close together
• Helps organize information and reduces clutter

## Structuring An Agile Project
- Describe the difference between agile and scrum

Agile promotes a project management system that encourages frequent inspection and adaption.


### Agile Life Cycle
- Feasibility: (Business) Project Plan
- Road map: Build product backlog, determine feature/story/task priority & time complexity, develop plan & cost estimates, establish team
- Setup: Hardware, software, tools, processes, high-level architecture, and process models
- Development: Requirements -> design -> implementation -> QA
- Pre-release: Final acceptance testing, documentation, training, deployment
- Production: Operate support systems, identify defects & enhancements

### Scrum
scrum < agile

Scrum (like kanbam) is a method for development iterations.

https://www.nutcache.com/blog/confusing-scrum-with-agile-heres-what-you-need-to-know/

## Scrum Roles & Processes
- Describe scrum
- List the roles & responsibilities in a Scrum team
- Describe the Scrum events
- Describe the Scrum artifacts
- Describe the importance of Scrum's identify and adapt pattern

### Scrum
- Framework for adaptively addressing complex problems
- Allows for a range of processes and techniques
- Applicable outside software development

### Theory
- Transparency: All aspects must be known, discussions should be open, common understanding of processes and terms (eg "done")
- Inspection: Artifacts & processes visited frequently?
- Adaption: If inspection turns up an unacceptable variance an adjustment needs to be made quickly, inspection/adaption cycle can happen within each event (planning, daily scrum, review, retrospective)

### Values
"When the values of commitment, courage, focus,
openness and respect are embodied and lived by
the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency,
inspection, and adaptation come to life and build
trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn
and explore those values as they work with the
Scrum roles, events, and artifacts"

### Team Roles
There is a cooperative structure with no hierarchy. Direct and consistent interaction occurs.

- Developers: 3 < # DEV < 12, do increments towards "done", self-organizing, no lead developer, no sub-teams, cross functional, takes cues from PO
- Scrum Master: leads Scrum process, manages events, facilitates understanding of goals and management of backlog with PO, coaches development team, removes development obstacles, ambassador of Scrum process
- PO: Represents the business, manages the product backlog (business priorities, next iteration items, visibility & clarity & transparency), maximizes the value of the product and team

### Events
All events allow for introspection & adaption.

- Sprint process: time-boxed, can be cancelled but not altered
- Sprint planning: short planning session for sprint process, based on backlog, sprint size based on developer experience, should work towards goals defined by the PO, method to work towards "done" defined by the developers
- Daily scrum: daily fifteen-minute meeting for development team, used to plan for the next day of work, identifies progress/plan/impediments, Scrum master hosted
- Sprint review: Half-day event for one month sprint, not a status meeting, PO declares items "done", developers discuss what went well/bad & how to improve, PO discusses project backlog, discusses next steps, review timeline/budget
- Sprint retrospective: Introspective review of the team and how to improve, review ppl/relationships/processes/tools, major things that went well/bad, plan for improvement

### Artifacts
- Product backlog: Living artifacts, possible increments that could be worked on, could be feature/function/requirement/enchancement/fix, could be at various stages of completion (description, priority, time estimate, status, value)
- Sprint backlog: Created by developers, subset of product backlog
- Progress monitoring: backlogs show progress, burn down chart, transparent, highly visible

### Product Backlog Entries
- Managed by PO with input from others
- Description is usually represented by a user story
- Order conveys dependence
- Priority -> dependency, value
- Effort estimation (story points) using different scales
- Intended to establish relative value
- Entry status to describe what is "done" vs. "not done"

## Introduction To Lean
- List the features of the lean process
- Generally describe the lean process

### What is Lean
- Set of procedures developed for your organization based on the results of experiments

### Principles
- Eliminate waste: Remove tasks switching, unnecessary things, waiting, defects, management activities. Software development -> building the wrong thing, task switching, waiting, mismanaging the backlog, reworking, unnecessarily complex
- Amplify learning: iteration of work, communicate results, test as close to development as possible, feedback & reflection
- Decide as later & as fast as possible: only do requirements/design when item needs to be built, deliver value as close to the definition as possible
- Empower the team: give the development team authority, give them coaching to do so
- Build integrity in: Build checks into the process, automate all tedious tasks
- See the whole: Keep the big picture in mind

### Process
1. Identify value: who is the customer, who is the person who ultimately uses the product of service
2. Map value stream: Identify value stream for each product and challenge all wasted steps
3. Create flow: Make the product flow continuously, identify bottlenecks, consider batch vs. continuous flow
4. Establish pull: Introduce pull between all steps where continuous flow is possible, consider pull vs. push processes
5. Seek perfection: keep evaluating the value stream, look for tuning opportunities

## Introduction to DevOps
- Describe the problem that DevOps solves

### Before
The cycle `code -> test -> deploy -> monitor -> maintain` was fairly fixed. Not much iteration.

### Now
Agile introduces benefits. Continuous integration and continuous deployment allow for quicker releases. New code can be deployed immediately upon sign-off.


### Challenges
Agile allows us to continuously deliver value to users. Greater chance for things to go wrong. Need QA for deployment process.

### Enter DevOps
- Integrate developer + operations team
- Aim to reduce friction and improve the deployment process.
- Uses lean/agile principles.

### Tools
- Standardization: processes (how things travel through deployment, timing), tools/tech (hardware, OS, packages, versions, software configuration)
- Automation: script everything, use schedulers & triggers
- Feedback: monitor & improve :)

### Impact of The Cloud
- Made DevOps much easier
- Virtualization
