# Exam
## The Grand Opening
- List of the topics of the course
- List the grade distribution

It is important to find out what people want/need.

We will focus on the traditional SDLC and then agile. We will also look a DevOps.

## Systems Development Environment
- Define information systems analysis and design
- Describe the role of the systems analyst in information systems development

### Information Systems Analysis and Design
- Provides a structure to create/maintain software business systems
- and improve employee efficiency
- Requires analysis and design based on an understanding of the business objectives, structure and processes
- and knowledge of IT (optional but advantageous)

### Life Cycle
- Systems planning and selection
- Systems analysis
- Systems design
- Systems implementation and operating

### Goals
- Improve an organizations system (acquire/develop software, train employees)
- Software should support an organizations function/processes
- System should turn data into usable information using hardware/software, documentation & training, security controls, job roles, participation from employees

### System
- Set of business procedures used within a business for a purpose
- Exists within an environment but has a boundary
- Also has a purpose, constraints, inputs/outputs, interfaces, and related components

### Development Process
- Process for creating these systems
- Consists of methodologies, techniques and tools

### Important Concepts
- Decoupling
- Modularity
- Cohesion
- System integration

### Your Role
- Study organizations problems
- Identify best approach
- Help customers define requirements

## Software Development Life Cycle
- Describe the database SDLC
- List three things that threaten software projects
- List three ways to adapt the SDLC to address the threats

### Two Approaches
- Waterfall (fixed, one cycle, longer planning, comprehensive)
- Prototype (iterative, same steps, define database during the development of the initial prototype, repeat for new prototypes)

### Waterfall
- Planning (enterprise & data modeling, preliminary understanding, request for study)
- Analysis (thorough data modeling, requirements analysis & structuring, programs/data structures & technology purchases &organization redesigns)
- Logical design (logical database design ie. transactions & views & security, develop technology & organization specifications, detailed design specifications)
- Physical design (define database to DBMS & database programs, information requirements elicitation and structure, program/data structures & technology purchases)
- Implementation (programming & documentation, programming & testing & training & documentation, operational programs & documentation)
- Maintenance (database maintenance, repair & monitor, audits)

### Shortcomings
- How does this address change, risk, and confidence?
- Use AGILE!

## Systems Planning & Selection
- Identify the steps in planning & selecting projects
- Explain the purpose of a Systems Request

### Where do ideas come from?
- Managers & business groups, corporate planning units, IT/IS groups
- Could be strategic plans from corporate or improvements at work-group level

### Business Process Managements
- Can be totally new
- OR re-engineer an existing system
- BPR
- BPI

### Systems Request
- Used to evaluate against alternatives
- Identifies sponsor (client, internal business and/or technical unit), business needs, business requirements, business value (tangible vs intangible value), issues and constraints (timeline, regulations)
- Outcomes include rejections, accept, delay, modifications, purchase system, refocus

### Project Initiation & Planning
Activities include:
- Project initiation team
- Customer relationships
- Project initiation plan
- Management procedures
- Environment & workbook
- Describe scope, alternatives, feasibility
- Identify and assess risks
- Develop schedule
- Develop communication plan
- Create budget
- Create BPP
- Create tasks

#### Project Charter
A short document that includes:
- PM, customer
- start/end dates
- stakeholders, roles, responsibilities
- Project objectives & description
- Assumptions
- Stakeholders sign off

#### Feasibility
- Economic
- Political
- Operational
- Technical
- Legal
- Schedule

## Assessing Feasibility
- List and describe feasibility dimensions
- Differentiate between tangible and intangible benefits
- Carry out simple feasibility analysis

### Economic
Should we build it?

- Perform cost/benefit analysis
- Ongoing/one-time costs/benefits
- Look at tangible/intangible economic benefits

#### Tangible
- Error reduction
- Hardware costs
- Increased speed

#### Intangible
- Increased productivity/morale
- Loss of consumer trust

#### Tools
- ROI
- Break even analysis
- NPV

### Other Feasibility
- Operational -> how can new processes fit into the current business processes? Is it strategically aligned?
- Technological -> groups understanding of hardware/software? Can they do it? Is it compatible with existing solutions? Does the group have experience with projects of a similar scope?
- Political -> business politics. Does the project have a champion? Do they have enough power? Are stakeholders blocking the project?
- Schedule -> can it meet deadlines and constraints?
- Legal -> Labour agreements, non-disclosure, anti-trust, privacy, foreign trade legislation. Using contractors may increase risks.

## Project Management

### Information Gathering
- Fact finding
- Modeling existing/proposed processes/systems

#### Sources
- People (client/sponsor, users, IT)
- Reports (outputs)
- Forms (inputs)
- Procedures and manuals

#### Helpful Characteristics
- Impertinence (question everything)
- Impartiality (reserve judgement & seek understanding)
- Relaxing constraints
- Attention to detail
- Reframe problem

#### Requirements Artifacts
- Interview notes
- Existing documents
- Data (inventory of digital resources)
- Understanding of business components (objectives, information needs, rules, key/trigger events)

#### Traditional Methods
- Interviews (current issues, future needs)
- Observation (activities, information used)
- Business documents (policies, issues, rules, concrete examples)

### System Requirements
#### Functional
- "Must perform" activities
- Derived from BPP
- Based on functions and rules
- Example: On-boarding new employee

#### Non-functional
- Quality attributes
- Technical (must use organizations technical infrastructure)
- Performance
- Usability
- Security
- Reliability

## Define & Prioritize Requirements
- Describe three different model types
- Name 3 different graphical modeling techniques
- Build simple DFD

System Requirements gathering is about identifying the key components of the system.

### Models
- Mathematical (formulas, notation). Useful in technical requirements.
- Descriptive (memos, forms, reports, lists). Actors defined in the processes.
- Graphical (processes, flows, system UI). Abstract.

Your arsenal includes:
- Flowcharts
- Activity diagrams
- Use cases

### Data Flow Diagrams
- Traditional method for process modeling
- Different levels of abstraction
- Fundamental elements includes: sources/sinks origin/destination (viewed as external to the system), data flows, data stores, processes (automated/manual manipulation of data)

### Rules
- Connections mean data flow
- Sources/sinks can connect to processes
- Processes can connect to data stores, processes, and oF course sources/sinks

### Levels
- Context level is the highest level (contains level 0 process)
- Level 0 process breaks down into level 0 DFD containing processes 1, 2, 3, 4
- These break down in x1, x2, x3, ...
- At some point, processes can be used a basis for use cases

### Verifying Models
- Need to verify correctness
- Uses cases can help
- Prototyping system UI
- Whatever choice should close feedback loop??

### Prioritizing Requirements
#### Categorizing Requirements
- Not all are equal
- Evaluate requirements against BPP
- Sort into mandatory, important, desirable

## Interviews
- Interpret basic body language
- Plan, conduct and review interview

### Kinesis
- Also known as body language
- Classification of gestures made with the body (facial, posture, breathing, handshakes, movements, gestures)
- Used to read attitude
- Manipulate emotions (feel at ease, get reaction)

### Why Interview
- Natural activity
- Able to gain much more information

### Steps
1. Selecting interviewees (sponsor/key-users can help, develop schedule, start at top and work your way down)
2. Designing questions (close ended, open ended, probing)
3. Preparing for interviews (design the flow, topics, segues, contact interviewees to confirm expertise, set up meeting time, set duration)
3. Conducting interviews (establish rapport, overview the project & their potential contribution, write everything down, always make sure you understand & ask questions if you don't, make time for interviewees to ask questions, explain what happens next)
4. Follow up (prepare report, send back for comments)

### Hazards
- No promises
- Interviewees might not share all they know if they aren't convinced of sincerity, importance.

## Generating & Evaluating Alternatives
No learning objectives.
