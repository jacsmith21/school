# A1
## Requirements
- This uses `c99`

## Running
First, build the appropriate question:
```shell
# Use one of the following commands to compile the code.
make q1
make q2
make q3
```

And then run:
```
./a.out
```

## Assumptions
1. The input comes from stdin.
2. Processes are identified by a *single* char.
3. The maximum size of a user's name is `10` characters.
4. Each input line does not exceed `100` characters.
5. For Q2 and Q3, if a CPU idles before it's completed all jobs, it does not need to print out `"%d	CPU %d IDLE"`. This isn't specified in the questions.
6. For Q3, if a CPU sees a job that hasn't arrived yet, it sleep until it arrives. Q3 is a bit vague IMO and left open to interpretation in some respects.
