# Remote Working
In the age of services, remote working has become commonplace. This practice, also known as telocommuting, involves the act of working in a remote location, usually from ones home, instead of a central office place. In Canada, more than 1.7 million paid employees worked from home in 2008, up from 1.4 million in 2000 [source1]. Today, most work can be completed completly independant of location. Although companies such as Yahoo and IBM have recently removed this practice in their workforce, remote working is here to stay. Even before these announcements, IBM had 40% of their employees working remotely in 2009. In a survey conducted in 2015 at London Business School's Leadership Summit, more than 34% of the 600 executives, entrpreneurs and academic indicated that more than 50% of the global workforce would be working remotely in 2020. Although this figure is an estimation, it is a relevant indicator of future trends. 

Remote working offers several potential benefits for both employees and companies. Working from home removes typical office distractions and commutes, while allowing employees to set most of their own hours. While these are great incentives for job seekers, this arrangement benefits the employers who often see increased productivity from these workers [source2]. The company also open themselves up to the global talent pool by removing location restrictions.

In the Information Technology Industry, working remotely has taken hold quiker than other industries. According to the stackoverflow 2017 developer survey, more than 50% of respondants listed remote options as a top priority and 11.1% indicated that they were already full-time remote. The IT industry is predisposed to remote working as most of ones work is already conducted on computers in a relatively independant way although, not completly. Although most software is written alone, collaboration is a key part of many software processes.

# Software Methadology
Since the beginning of software, process has became a key part and have become known as software development methadologies. They are process that seperate software development into phases to control the production of software. They are neccesary
