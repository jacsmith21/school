# Remote Working
In the age of services, remote working has become commonplace. This practice, also known as telocommuting, involves the act of working in a remote location, usually from ones home, instead of a central office place. In Canada, more than 1.7 million paid employees worked from home in 2008, up from 1.4 million in 2000 [source]. Today, most work can be completed completly independant of location. In addition, remote working benifits such as increased productivity, more free time and reduced cost among others are often cited by companies and employees alike. Although companies such as Yahoo and IBM have recently removed this practice in their workforce, remote working is here to stay. Even before these announcements, IBM had 40% of their employees working remotely in 2009. In a survey conducted in 2015 at London Business School's Leadership Summit, more than 34% of the 600 executives, entrpreneurs and academic indicated that more than 50% of the global workforce would be global in 2020. Although this figure is an estimation, it is a relevant indicator of future trends.
