# Abstract
This paper details how to distributed teams continue to use an agile development methodology. The full abstract will be finished later.

# Remote Working
In the age of services, remote working has become commonplace. This practice, also known as telocommuting, involves the act of working in a remote location, usually from ones home, instead of a central office place. In Canada, more than 1.7 million paid employees worked from home in 2008, up from 1.4 million in 2000 [source1]. Today, most work can be completed completly independant of location. Although companies such as Yahoo and IBM have recently removed this practice in their workforce, remote working is here to stay. Even before these announcements, IBM had 40% of their employees working remotely in 2009. In a survey conducted in 2015 at London Business School's Leadership Summit, more than 34% of the 600 executives, entrpreneurs and academic indicated that more than 50% of the global workforce would be working remotely in 2020. Although this figure is an estimation, it is a relevant indicator of future trends. 

Remote working offers several potential benefits for both employees and companies. Working from home removes typical office distractions and commutes, while allowing employees to set most of their own hours. While these are great incentives for job seekers, this arrangement benefits the employers who often see increased productivity from these workers [source2]. The company also open themselves up to the global talent pool by removing location restrictions.

In the Information Technology Industry, working remotely has taken hold quiker than other industries. According to the stackoverflow 2017 developer survey, more than 50% of respondants listed remote options as a top priority and 11.1% indicated that they were already full-time remote [source3]. The IT industry is predisposed to remote working as most of ones work is already conducted on computers in a relatively independant way although, not completly. Although most software is written alone, collaboration is a key part of many software processes.

# Software Methadology
Since the beginning of software, process has became a key part and have become known as software development methadologies. They are process that seperate software development into phases to control the production of software. Initially, they were developped with regards to typical engineering proccess in industries such as civil engineering or chemical engineering; however, these industries are inherently different than the software industry. Each software project must innovate, meaning something must be different than other software projects. This is not the case within projects such as bridge building where there are strict requirements and little room for change. Therefore, the processes followed should be different as well. 

In 2001 in the mountains of Utah, 17 individuals met to discuess a new software development methadology. The Agile manifesto emerged, a document describing principles and values describing the new agile software development methadology. The manifesto dictates teams should value individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to change [source4]. Today, agile is used to describe several different methadologies such as Scrum, Lead Development and many others. These methadologies are prefered over older methadologies as they prioritize being able to adapt to change where other methadologies had fallen short.

# Distributed Agile Teams
Agile methadologies have become commonplace within software development although, some teams have not been as willing to change from older methadologies. One of the primary reasons this has not occured has been that many teams are either distributed or dispersed. Agile was designed for teams who are located in the room. Co-located teams are able to maximize communication techniques and form relationships which promote trust and collaboration.

Distributed agile teams are still common within the software engineering industry. According to the 2016 State of Agile Report, 86% of respondents had at least one distributed team practicing agile within their company [source5]. This is up from 2011 when 65% who said they had distrubuted teams practicing agile in 2011 [source6]. Although agile was optmized for co-located teams, there exist other factors that influence the structure of teams. According to Sandeep Joshi, a Microsoft Senior Solution Architect, believes that due to the reality of doing business, a dispersed or distributed team is often necessary to access more talent and to be able to outsource development projects [source7]. Futhermore, many software developers prioritize remote options when job searching. Companies must therefore learn to adapt agile methadologies independantly of team distribution.
