# Abstract
This paper details how to distributed teams continue to use an agile development methodology. The full abstract will be finished later.

# Remote Working
In the age of services, remote working has become commonplace. This practice, also known as telecommuting, involves the act of working in a remote location, usually from ones home, instead of a central office place. In Canada, more than 1.7 million paid employees worked from home in 2008, up from 1.4 million in 2000[^1]. Today, most work can be completed completely independent of location. Although companies such as Yahoo and IBM have recently removed this practice in their workforce, remote working is here to stay. Even before these announcements, IBM had 40% of their employees working remotely in 2009. In a survey conducted in 2015 at London Business School's Leadership Summit, more than 34% of the 600 executives, entrepreneurs and academic indicated that more than 50% of the global workforce would be working remotely in 2020. Although this figure is an estimation, it is a relevant indicator of future trends.

Remote working offers several potential benefits for both employees and companies. Working from home removes typical office distractions and commutes, while allowing employees to set most of their own hours. While these are great incentives for job seekers, this arrangement benefits the employers who often see increased productivity from these workers[^2]. The company also open themselves up to the global talent pool by removing location restrictions.

In the Information Technology Industry, working remotely has taken hold quicker than other industries. According to the stackoverflow 2017 developer survey, more than 50% of respondents listed remote options as a top priority and 11.1% indicated that they were already full-time remote[^3]. The IT industry is predisposed to remote working as most of ones work is already conducted on computers in a relatively independent way although, not completely. Although most software is written alone, collaboration is a key part of many software processes.

# Software Methodology
Since the beginning of software, process has became a key part and have become known as software development methodologies. They are process that separate software development into phases to control the production of software. Initially, they were developed with regards to typical engineering process in industries such as civil engineering or chemical engineering; however, these industries are inherently different than the software industry. Each software project must innovate, meaning something must be different than other software projects. This is not the case within projects such as bridge building where there are strict requirements and little room for change. Therefore, the processes followed should be different as well.

In 2001 in the mountains of Utah, 17 individuals met to discuss a new software development methodology. The Agile manifesto emerged, a document describing principles and values describing the new agile software development methodology. The manifesto dictates teams should value individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to change[^4]. Today, agile is used to describe several different methodologies such as Scrum, Lead Development and many others. These methodologies are preferred over older methodologies as they prioritize being able to adapt to change where other methodologies had fallen short.

# Distributed Agile Teams
Agile methodologies have become commonplace within software development although, some teams have not been as willing to change from older methodologies. One of the primary reasons this has not occurred has been that many teams are either distributed or dispersed. Agile was designed for teams who are located in the room. Co-located teams are able to maximize communication techniques and form relationships which promote trust and collaboration.

Distributed agile teams are still common within the software engineering industry. According to the 2016 State of Agile Report, 86% of respondents had at least one distributed team practicing agile within their company[^5]. This is up from 2011 when 65% who said they had distributed teams practicing agile in 2011[^6]. Although agile was optimized for co-located teams, there exist other factors that influence the structure of teams. According to Sandeep Joshi, a Microsoft Senior Solution Architect, believes that due to the reality of doing business, a dispersed or distributed team is often necessary to access more talent and to be able to outsource development projects[^7]. Furthermore, many software developers prioritize remote options when job searching. Companies must therefore learn to adapt agile methodologies independently of team distribution.

Key agile principles are broken or are made difficult with distributed or dispersed teams. One such principle from the agile manifesto dictates that "the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation"[^4]. Another that "business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project". Many challenges, such as inexperience, lack of company support or a culture that is at odds with core agile values, are already faced by teams attempting to adopt agile. If non co-located teams adapt agile methodologies, they will face increased difficulties primarily due to communication inefficiencies. Teams may employ several strategies for adapting and maintain the agile methodology within distributed or dispersed teams.

# Strategies for Adapting a Distributed or Dispersed Agile Team
## Enforcing Agile
When establishing an agile team, it is essential to integrate agile principles into the teams culture. Company philosophy may be at odds with some of the core principles or there may resistance to change. For example, teams may try avoid certain agile procedures when initially introduced or near releases when processes break down. Team leaders should completely familiarize themselves with agile methodologies and enforce them, especially during the critical times. This strategy attempts to minimize many of the common pitfalls or adopting or scaling agile development; however, it is particularly important within teams who are not co-located. It is especially difficult to establish agile as the norm if not all locations are as dedicated towards the new methodology as others.

## Open Communication
Face to face communication across teams is a key aspect of agile development. Therefore, within distributed and dispersed agile teams, it is more important to foster open communication. Team members should be aware of the increased burden of communication and should be open to new communication methods and initially place effort in being available[^7]. Video conferencing is an important tool that should be used across distributed teams[^8]. It acts as a proxy for true in person communication; however, it still has limitations. The time spent on video calls will often resemble meeting rather than a casual conversation. In addition, they also limit non-verbal communication and have difficulty conveying complex information such as challenges, successes and opportunities.
> “The best communication is face to face, with communications occurring through facial expression, body language, intonation and words. When a white board is thrown in and the teams work out design as a group, the communication bandwidth absolutely sizzles” - Ken Schwaber, author of *The Enterprise and Scrum*

For example, teams may try and promote casual one-on-one video conferencing or other forms of casual communication. With time, these may become team habits and reduce the communication limitations associated with dispersed or distributed teams. This strategy If teams are going to succeed, every team member needs to commit to making agile work.

## Smart Structure
This technique applies to any sort of global team. Good system architecture mandates loose cohesion. If teams are constructed correctly, they should be able work almost independently on their own subsystem. With a good team structure, necessary communication between locations can be minimized. Team size and mix should also be prioritized[^8]. Problems may arise when one location specialize in a particular task, such as development or quality assurance. This structure may lead to inadequate communication within teams where information flows only one direction. if problems arise, certain teams will be more willing to place blame on other teams. Furthermore, specialized teams will also increase recruitment costs as they limit a particular locations ability to only hire those with the particular set of skills.

Workload should also be evenly distributed across team member. An uneven workload affects the project delivery schedule and the quality of code produced. This is not a unique problem to distributed and dispersed teams; however, it is made worse due to communication constraints. It should be made clear to each team member that is their responsibility to communicate workload inefficiencies. It is also the team leaders responsibility to ensure these problems are addressed and to try to take preventative measures. For example, Sandeep Joshi recommends conducting a Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) analysis with each team member[^7]. These analysis are conducted one-on-one and measure time, mental effort and psychological stress loads on individuals [^9].

## Sharing Code
Within any software development team, it is important to create an environment where knowledge is distributed. This eases system maintenance by decreasing dependence on particular team members while also increasing overall code quality. For example, if production issues of one subsystem arises during the off hours of one particular team, another may be able to step in and quickly resolve the issue. Within remote agile teams, there are difficulties that arise when trying to implement this system.

Pair programming, where two developers simultaneously collaborate on the same code, is a common practice among agile teams. Extreme programming, one agile methodology, mandates that all code be written using this method. Within distributed teams, it is difficult to implement this technique as developers are not able to work *side by side*. This experience can be partially imitated using online tools although, these tools face the same communication limitations mentioned earlier.

Other practices to help distribute knowledge and increase code quality include code reviews and *show and tell* sessions. The former is an already common practice among agile teams where code is reviewed by one or more team members. The latter is a live code review session where each member demonstrates the code they wrote to team members and receives feedback. Both of these techniques distribute knowledge while fostering code quality and reusability. All of these techniques where developers are able to share and receive feedback on the code they wrote are incredibly important to any agile team, especially those who are distributed or dispersed.

## Cultural Awareness
Every individual comes from a different cultural background. This can be apparent even within co-located teams; however, cultural differences become much more common when teams are distributed across several countries. Where agile principles place an emphasis on individuals and interactions, team members should be especially aware of these differences. Understanding these cultural differences helps you to better understand why people take the actions they do. For example, authority is perceived differently across cultures. In some, it's ok to challenge authority whereas in others authority is more absolute. Not only is it important for every individual to have a general cultural awareness, one can try to minimize these differences by creating team habits. For example, as there exists cultural differences for timeliness, one might try and set a precedent for being on time for meetings.

## Time Differences & Maximize Golden Hours
Teams who work across varying time zones face unique problems. As these differences grow, so does the need for specific procedures to mitigate the resulting difficulties. Asynchronous communication, where team members communicate without immediate responses, become especially dangerous when important messages fail to be answered due to these time zone differences. Imagine a developer who needs clarification about particular change in code and is therefore unable to complete his work until the following day when he receives an answer. This may be a worse case scenario although, situations similar to these are likely to occur daily if the time zones are large and developer work overlaps. Sandeep

Joshi recommends *developer-to-developer* handshakes, where developers communicate changes they've made, build status and any known issues[^7]. Any other relevant information should also be conveyed to minimize the need for any further communication and to streamline the development process. *Golden hours*, a term taken from photography, are the hours Dan Radigan uses to describe the time when all of the distributed teams and remote employees are working[^8]. Teams should use these hours to hold important meetings and for synchronous conversation.

## Development Culture
Establishing a clear development culture is an essential part of any team, especially one that is distributed or dispersed. These cultural practices that typically aren't as important within a co-located team become essential due to communication limitations. This can also be seen as setting clear guidelines for teams such as:
* Definition of done
* Branching
* Development environment setup
* Bug reporting
* Code review
* Code style
* Release
* Testing

The points above should be established to ensure a consistent development culture across team locations. Several of these guidelines, including branching, bug reporting and testing, code review and release, may be seen as a complete development. When establishing these guidelines, the whole development process should be covered. This should ensure there are no discrepancies between locations. It is important to establish some sort of document that allows team members to easily set up their development environments. Each team member should be working in the same environment to minimize setup problems or problems pushing code to production. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish a clear definition of done. This removes any sort of residual ambiguity about the development process.

# Tools for Agile Teams
Agile project management tools should be employed by any team practicing agile development. These tools help teams organize projects and help teams communicate updates, share work and track issues. Furthermore, they can help maintain a clear development culture.
