# Abstract
This paper details how to distributed teams continue to use an agile development methodology. The full abstract will be finished later.

# Remote Working
In the age of services, remote working has become commonplace. This practice, also known as telocommuting, involves the act of working in a remote location, usually from ones home, instead of a central office place. In Canada, more than 1.7 million paid employees worked from home in 2008, up from 1.4 million in 2000 [source1]. Today, most work can be completed completly independant of location. Although companies such as Yahoo and IBM have recently removed this practice in their workforce, remote working is here to stay. Even before these announcements, IBM had 40% of their employees working remotely in 2009. In a survey conducted in 2015 at London Business School's Leadership Summit, more than 34% of the 600 executives, entrpreneurs and academic indicated that more than 50% of the global workforce would be working remotely in 2020. Although this figure is an estimation, it is a relevant indicator of future trends.

Remote working offers several potential benefits for both employees and companies. Working from home removes typical office distractions and commutes, while allowing employees to set most of their own hours. While these are great incentives for job seekers, this arrangement benefits the employers who often see increased productivity from these workers [source2]. The company also open themselves up to the global talent pool by removing location restrictions.

In the Information Technology Industry, working remotely has taken hold quiker than other industries. According to the stackoverflow 2017 developer survey, more than 50% of respondants listed remote options as a top priority and 11.1% indicated that they were already full-time remote [source3]. The IT industry is predisposed to remote working as most of ones work is already conducted on computers in a relatively independant way although, not completly. Although most software is written alone, collaboration is a key part of many software processes.

# Software Methadology
Since the beginning of software, process has became a key part and have become known as software development methadologies. They are process that seperate software development into phases to control the production of software. Initially, they were developped with regards to typical engineering proccess in industries such as civil engineering or chemical engineering; however, these industries are inherently different than the software industry. Each software project must innovate, meaning something must be different than other software projects. This is not the case within projects such as bridge building where there are strict requirements and little room for change. Therefore, the processes followed should be different as well.

In 2001 in the mountains of Utah, 17 individuals met to discuess a new software development methadology. The Agile manifesto emerged, a document describing principles and values describing the new agile software development methadology. The manifesto dictates teams should value individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to change [source4]. Today, agile is used to describe several different methadologies such as Scrum, Lead Development and many others. These methadologies are prefered over older methadologies as they prioritize being able to adapt to change where other methadologies had fallen short.

# Distributed Agile Teams
Agile methadologies have become commonplace within software development although, some teams have not been as willing to change from older methadologies. One of the primary reasons this has not occured has been that many teams are either distributed or dispersed. Agile was designed for teams who are located in the room. Co-located teams are able to maximize communication techniques and form relationships which promote trust and collaboration.

Distributed agile teams are still common within the software engineering industry. According to the 2016 State of Agile Report, 86% of respondents had at least one distributed team practicing agile within their company [source5]. This is up from 2011 when 65% who said they had distrubuted teams practicing agile in 2011 [source6]. Although agile was optmized for co-located teams, there exist other factors that influence the structure of teams. According to Sandeep Joshi, a Microsoft Senior Solution Architect, believes that due to the reality of doing business, a dispersed or distributed team is often necessary to access more talent and to be able to outsource development projects [source7]. Futhermore, many software developers prioritize remote options when job searching. Companies must therefore learn to adapt agile methadologies independantly of team distribution.

Key agile principles are broken or are made difficult with distributed or dispersed teams. One such principle from the agile manifesto dictates that "the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation" [source4]. Another that "business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project". Many challenges, such as inexperience, lack of company support or a culture that is at odds with core agile values, are already faced by teams attempting to adopt agile. If non-colocated teams adapt agile methodologies, they will face increased defficulties primarily due to communication inneficiencies. Teams may employ several stratagies for apapting and maintaing the agile methodolofy within distributed or dispersed teams.

# Stratagies for Adapting a Distributed or Dispersed Agile Team
## Enforcing Agile
When establishing an agile team, it is essential to integrate agile principles into the teams culture. Compnay philosophy may be at odds with some of the core principles or there may resistance to change. For example, teams may try avoid certain agile procedures when initially introduced or near releases when processes break down. Team leaders should completly familiarize themselves with agile methodologies and enforce them, espcially during the critical times. This strategy attempts to minimize many of the common pitfalls or adopting or scaling agile development; however, it is particularly important within teams who are not co-located. It is escpecially difficult to establish agile as the norm if not all locations are as dedicated torwards the new methodology as others.

## Open Communication
Face to face communication across teams is a key aspect of agile development. Therefore, within distributed and dispersed agile teams, it is more important to foster open communication. Team members should be aware of the increased burden of communication and should be open to new communication methods and initially place effort in being available [source7]. Video conferencing is an important tool that should be used across distributed teams [source8]. It acts as a proxy for true in person communication; however, it still has limitations. The time spent on video calls will often resemble meeting rather than a casual conversation. In addition, they also limit non-verbal communication and have difficulty conveying complex information such as challenges, successes and opportunities.
> “The best communication is face to face, with communications occurring through facial expression, body language, intonation and words. When a white board is thrown in and the teams work out design as a group, the communication bandwidth absolutely sizzles” - Ken Schwaber, author of *The Enterprise and Scrum*

For example, teams may try and promote casual one-on-one video conferencing or other forms of casual communication. With time, these may become team habits and reduce the communication limitations associated with dispersed or distributed teams. This stratagy If teams are going to succed, every team member needs to commit to making agile work.

## Smart Structure
This technique applies to any sort of gloabl team. Good system architecture mandates loose cohesion. If teams are constructed correctly, they should be able work almost independently on their own subsystem. With a good team structure, necessary communication between locations can be minimized. Team size and mix should also be prioritized [source8]. Problems may arise when one location specialize in a particular task, such as development or quality assurance. This structure may lead to inadequate communication within teams where information flows only one direction. if problems arise, certain teams will be more willing to place blame on other teams. Furthermore, specialized teams will also increase recruitment costs as they limit a particular locations ability to only hire those with the particular set of skills.

Workload should also be evenly distributed across team member. An uneven workload affects the project delivery schedule and the quality of code produced. This is not a unique problem to distributed and dispersed teams; however, it is made worse due to communication constraints. It should be made clear to each team member that is their responsability to communicate workload inneficiencies. It is also the team leaders responsibilty to ensure these problems are addresed and to try to take preventative measures. For example, Sandeep Joshi recommends conducting a Subjective Workload Assesment Teachnique (SWAT) analysis with each team member [source7]. These anlysis are conducted one-on-one and measure time, mental effort and psychological stress loads on individuals [source9].

## Sharing Code
Within any software development team, it is important to create an environment where knowledge is distributed. This eases system maintenance by decreasing dependence on particular team memebers while also increasing overall code quality. For example, if production issues of one subsystem arises during the off hours of one particular team, another may be able to step in and quickly resolve the issue. Within remmote agile teams, there are difficulties that arise when trying to implement this system.

Pair programming, where two developers simultaneously collaborate on the same code, is a common practice among agile teams. Extreme programming, one agile methodology, mandates that all code be written using this method. Within distributed teams, it is difficult to implement this technique as developers are not able to work *side by side*. This experience can be partially imitated using online tools althoug, these tools face the same communication limitations mentioned earlier.

Other practices to help distribute knowledge and increase code quality include code reviews and *show and tell* sessions. The former is an already common practice among agile teams where code is reviewed by one or more team members. The latter is a live code review session where each member demonstrates the code they wrote to team members and recieves feedback. Both of these techniques distribute knowledge while fostering code quality and reusability. All of these techniques where developers are able to share and recieve feedback on the code they wrote are incredibly important to any agile team, especially those who are distriubuted or dispersed.

## Cultural Awareness
Every individual comes from a different cultural background. This becomes apparent between countries and especially different continents. Where agile teams place an emphasis on individuals and interactions, team members should be especially aware of these differences. For example, being on time for meetings is important in some cultures whereas it is not as important in others. Not only is it important for every individual to have a general cultural awareness, one can try to minimize these differences by creating a common team culture.

## Time Differences & Maximize Golden Hours
Teams who work across varying time zones face unique problems. As the time differences increase, so does the need for specific procedure to mitigate these problems. According to [Microsoft], *developer-to-developer* handshakes and end of day updates by each developer should be used to decrease the need for clarification or rework. These updates should clarify what code was changed, build status and any known issues.

Each team should be totally aware of the time zone difference of other teams they work with. *Golden hours*, the hours when all of the teams are in the office, should be maximized. This is when communication is most similar to face to face communication.
