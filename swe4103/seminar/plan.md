The current topic for the paper is `How to Maintain an Agile Team With a Distributed Workforce`.

The current theme for the paper is: `Remote Agile`

# Introduction
The introduction paragraph providing a short abstract for the reader.

# Remote Working
## What is Remote Working
The section explains the basics of remote working. It will mention a few stats about remote working and provide trends for the future. It will answer questions such as what is it, who uses it and why it's used.

## Remote Working within the Information Technology Industry
This section will further explain how remote working is used within the information technology industry. It will point out the differences within this sector, specifically addressing the differences to the what, where, who , when and why questions.

# Agile
## Old Methodologies
This section will detail some of the old methodologies and some of their pitfalls when used within a software development project. This section will not provide any more details than necessary.

## Agile
This section will explain the basics of the agile methodology using the [Agile Manifesto]. It will answer questions such as what is it (the rules), who uses it and why do they use it and reinforce reasons why it is preferred over old methodologies.

# Remote Working & Agile
This will be a longer section. Again, it will answer questions such as how and why people use remote working and agile together and will outline difficulties.

## Information about Distributed Agile Teams
This section will list some basic information about distributed agile teams. For example, according to the 2016 [State of Agile Report]:
> 86% of respondents had at least some distributed teams practicing agile.

## Why Remote Working & Agile
This section will describe why teams may still want to use agile within a distributed workforce even with the added difficulties. [Microsoft] says that due to the reality of doing business, a global team is often necessary to access more talent and to be able to outsource development work.

## Difficulties of Maintaining an Agile Workflow within a Distributed Team
This is an important section as it will set up much of the rest of the paper. Like the title implies, it will describe the difficulties of maintaining an agile workflow within a distributed team.

Some of the key rules will be broken as a result of the distributed teams which will all be detailed here. This section will be short however as it will only act as a transition.

# Methods and Tools for Maintaining an Distributed Agile Team
This section will detail the methods and tools that are usually adapted by distributed teams that maintain an agile workflow. It will describe how teams maintain an agile workflow while working in different time-zones and locations.

Agile teams are supposed to work in close proximity. According to [Atlassian], several problems arise when agile teams are distributed such as:

1. Asynchronous communication
2. Inability to form a close relationship with remote coworkers
3. Difference in workplace (development) culture
4. Difficulty scheduling meetings

# Principles and Tools for Maintaining an Distributed Agile Team
This section will detail the methods and tools that are usually adapted by distributed teams that maintain an agile workflow.

## Structure
This is likely the most important method for managing distributed agile teams. With a good team structure, necessary communication can be minimized. Good system architecture mandates loose cohesion. If teams are constructed correctly, they should be able work almost independently on their own subsystem.

According to [Microsoft], team size and mix should also be prioritized. It isn't a good idea to have one location specialize in a particular task, such as development or quality assurance. This structure may lead to inadequate communication where information may only flow in one direction and if problems arise, teams may be more willing to place blame on other teams. Specialized teams will also increase recruitment costs.

Work should also be evenly distributed across each location. An uneven workload affects the project delivery schedule and the quality of code produced. This is a unique problem which arises due to communication constraints. Bottlenecks as a result of strained developers are the cause.

## Sharing your Work
Within distributed agile teams, it is important to create an environment where knowledge is also distributed. This eases system maintenance by decreasing dependence on particular teams and increase overall code quality. For example, if production issues of one subsystem arises during the off hours of one particular team another may be able to step in and quickly resolve the issue.

Pair programming, where two developers simultaneously collaborate on the same code, is a common practice among agile teams. Within distributed teams, this becomes more difficult as developers are not able to work *side by side*. This experience can be imitated using online tools although, it faces common communication limitations.

On tool to help minimize distributed knowledge is to implement code reviews across distributed teams.

## Relationships & Communication
Face to face communication across teams is a key aspect of agile development. Therefore, within distributed agile teams, it is even more important to foster relationships.

Video conferencing is an important tool that should be used across distributed teams. It acts as a proxy for true in person communication; however, it still has limitations. The time spent on video calls will often resemble meeting rather than a casual conversation. In addition, they also limit non-verbal communication and have difficulty conveying complex information such as challenges, successes and opportunities. If a team is truly distributed and agile, they should promote casual one on one video conferencing and other forms of casual communication.

According to [Microsoft], team members should be made aware of the additional communication responsibilities. The commitment of every member is needed to make agile work and team leaders should become mentors, especially during the transition phases.

If possible, team meet-up events should routinely take place to further build rapport.

## Culture
Every successful agile team needs a development culture. As a result of the increased communication burden, ensuring a consistent development culture becomes more difficult. There exists several principles to minimize this burden.

1. Over communicate decisions
2. Minimize the difficulty of setting up the local development environment
3. Create a clear definition of done
4. Create clear guidelines for bug reporting

## Maximize Golden Hours
The "golden hours" of any distributed team are the hours when all of the teams are in the office. These should be maximized.
